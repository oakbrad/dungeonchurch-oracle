To the happy days with the [Celestia de Lamour](/doc/celestia-de-lamour-w5YwcY3B29) before they betrayed you and left you for dead. Days spent in the swamp, learning the names of all the plants and animals under the tutelage of your father. And you remember your father and elders teaching you a deep respect for birds, as they are the only ones who are clever enough to carry omens and messages across the boundary of the planes that separate us from the gods. \\n\\nBut the winged monster in front of you is not a bird. It should not exist in this age at all. Your mind reels and more memories and emotions flood over you\u2026.\\n\\nYou remember a dream you had, right after you met up with this group of adventurers here. You were in the swamp again, a young woman, watching a raven. The raven picks up a tool - a small twig - and appears to look you straight in the eye in a knowing manner, before scratching a symbol in the mud\u2026.\n\n\n:::info\nAma draws *Temperance*\n\n:::\n\nThe [young black dragon](/doc/young-black-dragon-vIuFIXJjiJ) extends it\u2019s wings and exhales a deadly line of acid breath through the door way. Grey takes the brunt of it full on in the face, and is severely injured. Both he and Bahruhn position themselves outside the door, ready for the beast to emerge. The dragon fills the room with magical fog and taunts the party, mimicking their own voices back at them.\n\nFinally it emerges and screams in Draconic, \u201cI will feed you and make you compost to my master below!\u201d & attacks. It spreads it\u2019s wings and Grey is able to knock it off balance with his shield, but doing damage through the thick dragonscale is difficult. Bahruhn is knocked unconscious while Greyson is able to sneak in and do lots of damage with his daggers.\n\nFinally, the dragon falls leaking black ichor and acid. Ama takes a few teeth, and Grey gets busy field dressing the corpse. Greyson checks the room and finds a small hoard the dragon had assembled while free: gold and gems, a few magical items, a [new shield](/doc/shield-of-missile-deflection-cltEpG9HRg) for Grey, and most strangely\u2026 a gilded painted portrait of a knight that Greyson and Ama recognize as [Lamont Solmar](/doc/lamont-solmar-GLrWBoIX5h).\n\n# Collector of Souls\n\nThe party quickly collects some fresh dragon\u2019s blood and calls for the gnomes and [Yusdrayl](/doc/yusdrayl-JyU80S0S6K) to bring their artifact. The gnome queen dips [the black pyramid](/doc/the-black-pyramid-guKpfa163p) in the black blood and the runes on it\u2019s surface begin to glow and emit a faint light. Yusdrayl says, \u201cIf you are going further into the temple, take this. It will free the souls of the damned Dragonborn who are enslaved here by the Dark Druid.\u201d She also gives them the Dragon Key that Greyson had already [copied](/doc/skeleton-key-aCKEViKMZf).\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=e5fc579b-44a9-4d65-8362-b1c09ea1c7db)\n\nThe gnomes offer a safe place to rest in a guarded room, near the tunnel that leads back to their homeland in the Underdark. Greyson recounts the tale of how [he found Lamont Solmar\u2019s watch](/doc/session-11-plots-under-the-mountain-5QCSooTv6K) and returned it to his young son [Anders](/doc/anders-solmor-njTKn6ITMV), who told them his father has disappeared on a hunting trip in the [Dreadwood](/doc/dreadwood-GcfKdBzGyT) long ago. Only later did he find out that Lamont had been turned into the antlered vampire who had [tried to poison everyone on board the Dragon\u2019s Jubilee](/doc/session-15-16-murder-on-the-jubilee-b5dYJiJkGZ), an undead servant of some [unholy sorceress](/doc/lady-nightshade-3kjLNj2Zbs).\n\nThe party wakes up to the sounds of the [gnomes](/doc/gnome-ARFvDASnZz) setting explosives on the columns in this area, working busily and unpacking crates of dynamite. Ama manages to pocket a few while Greyson attempts to negotiate with the gnomes to wait until at least tomorrow, since they still need to go further into the temple. The gnomes seem nonplussed, \u201cAyy there\u2019s plenty of ways out of here.\u201d\n\n# Ghosts\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=b44dd7b5-5624-425a-8bc1-033bef44dd1e)The party continues onward, back to where they fought the dragon. Ama insists they stop and watch for the butterflies that periodically flutter through. They notice that several are resting themselves on the door to the west, so Grey opens it. Inside is a huge ancient draconic cathedral, filled with dozens of emaciated Dragonborn ghosts bound in chains. Several overseers watch over them from spectral steeds. Ama takes out the black pyramid and yells out for the Dragonborn to be free! The souls of the enslaved drop their chains and begin to flicker as their connection to this plane is loosened. They are absorbed by the black pyramid, which glows with every soul that it collects.\n\n[The overseers](/doc/ghost-YHwND9y9uG) are not deterred or affected by this magic, they seem much stronger than the slaves. One uses it\u2019s horrifying visage on the party and most of them become afraid. Another magically closes the gap between themselves and the party and uses it\u2019s ghostly intimidation to scare Greyson so badly he ages 6 years on the spot, his hair growing gray streaks. Another takes possession of Grey completely. \n\nAs the party wields weapons and attempts to fight off the fell fiends, Grey walks calmly and slowly to a door in the north. He opens it and inside the next room is a large pit, glowing faintly violent and magenta, with roots and vines growing down it\u2019s sides into the abyss. He steps to the edge, and turning with unseeing eyes his (or his body) exclaims:\n\n> \u201cIn this twilight realm, \n>\n> I pledge my essence to the Knight of Night's antlered helm. \n>\n> My soul to tend the fields of fright, \n>\n> where nightmares bloom in the absence of light.\"\n\nHe throws himself into the abyss. The party screams *Nooooo!!!*\n\n# Beneath the Temple\n\nAfter defeating the ghosts, the party assembles at the edge of the hole that leads down and weighs their options. They can\u2019t see how far it goes because of a warm, humid mist that emits from below along with the pinkish light. As they discuss, more butterflies float past them and down into the hole - Ama recognizes them as a type of butterfly she knows and they seem to be carrying a familiar type of pollen\u2026. They go down on their ropes, finding Grey laying at the bottom, badly injured but not dead. They find themselves in a large cavern, the floor covered in a moist hummus of dirt and dead plants. Overhead the ceiling is covered with a patchwork of bioluminescent fungi that give this place it\u2019s magenta glow. The only things that grow here are sickly and\u2026 an abundance of flowering [Sapphire Nightshade](/doc/sapphire-nightshade-Qvbjiqksvy). Two humanoid figures with hoes and rakes, apparently made out of twigs and twisting roots like a scarecrow, dig unenthusiastically in the far north corner. Passages lead north, south, and east.\n\nThe party approaches these creatures and sees what they are burying\u2026 the hand of a small child sticks up out of a shallow grave.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=ebd0db6f-de41-4ec8-be80-d6626665b39c)\n\nThe party once again decides their course by looking for the butterflies. They open the eastward door into a gallery of small rooms, gardening implements lean up everywhere and rustic tables with dirty bulbs for planting. Everywhere around the room, neat wooden boxes of Sapphire Nightshade flowers as if they have just been harvested. Seeing no one obviously around, the party decides to go room to room clearing each.\n\nThey start with the southeast room, finding a mash tun and the *squish squish* of something inside it slowly macerating fruit. They cannot see who. Greyson uses his Hat of Disguise to transform himself into the Knight of Night complete with antlers, and then demands, \u201cHey you! Give me an update on what\u2019s going on here!\u201d\n\nAnother one of the [twig-humanoids](/doc/child-of-the-briar-sI5pUsj9VA) peers over the edge of the mash tun. \u201cYes m\u2019lord! I have prepared the latest batch - very potent! - just as you requested, and notice has been sent to the [Lady Amelia](/doc/amelia-mAibH1T0Em) in [Duskmire](/doc/duskmire-hJey19lfsu)! I think you will be most satisfied\u2026.\u201d Grey as the vampire Lamont says, \u201cExcellent, now listen carefully - no more of this must be done no matter who tells you not to - even myself! I will test you later so don\u2019t even believe me. You will only respond to the command `COWABUNGA`\u201c The dreadful creature dutifully agrees and the party shuts the door on him.\n\nThe next door has two of the stick creatures standing around a very distressed looking [Giant Rat](/doc/giant-rat-ie3aHmHneu), who has many tumors and growths on him that they poke with their stick fingers, watching the rat yell in torment. The party decides to kill these tormentors, and they take several vials of [this poison](/doc/nightshade-poison-rGISMbm8AA) from their supply. In the rest of the rooms the party finds just gardening implements, weapons, and other things related to the operation of some sort of plant nursery.\n\n# Arboretum\n\nAgain following the path of the butterflies carrying their magical pollen, the party continues eastward and deeper into the underground of this temple. As they move into a large chamber with several violet-lit arboretums of plant specimens leading off it. The walls and ceiling here are overgrown with roots of plants and sickly vines, everything seeming off somehow under the unnatural light of the fungi. Passing through the northward door they find a [gardener, stitched together out of corpses,](/doc/gardener-stitched-together-out-of-corpses-vnZcct7csI) dragging a sickle behind it over bumpy ground. \u201cWho goes there??\u201d This time Grey\u2019s disguise does not pass muster, and the party quickly takes down this abomination, freeing the stitches that hold it\u2019s mismatched body together. As it\u2019s corpse hits the ground it explodes into blood and ichor and decay, showering the party with foul liquids. In the man-shaped stain on the floor, several Sapphire Nightshades immediately spring up and bloom.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=cf46c53a-8d00-45b1-ba77-076c81d7f65c \" =309x309\")",

The new body appears within 5 feet of the phylactery.\n\n***Spellcasting.*** The lich is an 18th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 20, +12 to hit with spell attacks). The lich has the following wizard spells prepared:\n\n\\\nCantrips (at will): *mage hand*, *prestidigitation*, *ray of frost*1st level (4 slots): *detect magic*, *magic missile*, *shield*, *thunderwave*2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts*, *invisibility*, *Melf's acid arrow*, *mirror image*3rd level (3 slots): *animate dead*, *counterspell*, *dispel magic*, *fireball*4th level (3 slots): *blight*, *dimension door*5th level (3 slots): *cloudkill*, *scrying*6th level (1 slot): *disintegrate*, *globe of invulnerability*7th level (1 slot): *finger of death*, *plane shift*8th level (1 slot): *dominate monster*, *power word stun*9th level (1 slot): *power word kill*\n\n***Turn Resistance.*** The lich has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.\n\n### Actions\n\n***Paralyzing Touch.*** *Melee Spell Attack:*  +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 10 (3d6) cold damage. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n### Legendary Actions\n\nThe lich can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The lich regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.\n\n* **Cantrip.** The lich casts a cantrip.\n* **Paralyzing Touch (Costs 2 Actions).** The lich uses its Paralyzing Touch.\n* **Frightening Gaze (Costs 2 Actions).** The lich fixes its gaze on one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the lich's gaze for the next 24 hours.\n* **Disrupt Life (Costs 3 Actions).** Each non-undead creature within 20 feet of the lich must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw against this magic, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n## Lich\n\nLiches are the remains of great wizards who embrace undeath as a means of preserving themselves. They further their own power at any cost, having no interest in the affairs of the living except where those affairs interfere with their own. Scheming and insane, they hunger for long-forgotten knowledge and the most terrible secrets. Because the shadow of death doesn't hang over them, they can conceive plans that take years, decades, or centuries to come to fruition.\n\nA lich is a gaunt and skeletal humanoid with withered flesh stretched tight across its bones. Its eyes succumbed to decay long ago, but points of light burn in its empty sockets. It is often garbed in the moldering remains of fine clothing and jewelry worn and dulled by the passage of time.\n\n***Secrets of Undeath.*** No wizard takes up the path to lichdom on a whim, and the process of becoming a lich is a well-guarded secret. Wizards that seek lichdom must make bargains with fiends, evil gods, or other foul entities. Many turn to Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath, whose power has created countless liches. However, those that control the power of lichdom always demand fealty and service for their knowledge.\n\nA lich is created by an arcane ritual that traps the wizard's soul within a phylactery. Doing so binds the soul to the mortal world, preventing it from traveling to the Outer Planes after death. A phylactery is traditionally an amulet in the shape of a small box, but it can take the form of any item possessing an interior space into which arcane sigils of naming, binding, immortality, and dark magic are scribed in silver.\n\nWith its phylactery prepared, the future lich drinks a potion of transformation-a vile concoction of poison mixed with the blood of a sentient creature whose soul is sacrificed to the phylactery. The wizard falls dead, then rises as a lich as its soul is drawn into the phylactery, where it forever remains.\n\n***Soul Sacrifices.*** A lich must periodically feed souls to its phylactery to sustain the magic preserving its body and consciousness. It does this using the *imprisonment* spell. Instead of choosing one of the normal options of the spell, the lich uses the spell to magically trap the target's body and soul inside its phylactery. The phylactery must be on the same plane as the lich for the spell to work. A lich's phylactery can hold only one creature at a time, and a *dispel magic* cast as a 9th-level spell upon the phylactery releases any creature imprisoned within it. A creature imprisoned in the phylactery for 24 hours is consumed and destroyed utterly, whereupon nothing short of divine intervention can restore it to life.\n\nA lich that fails or forgets to maintain its body with sacrificed souls begins to physically fall apart, and might eventually become a demilich.\n\n***Death and Restoration.*** When a lich's body is broken by accident or assault, the will and mind of the lich drains from it, leaving only a lifeless corpse behind. Within days, a new body reforms next to the lich's phylactery, coalescing out of glowing smoke that issues from the device. Because the destruction of its phylactery means the possibility of eternal death, a lich usually keeps its phylactery in a hidden, well-guarded location.\n\nDestroying a lich's phylactery is no easy task and often requires a special ritual, item, or weapon. Every phylactery is unique, and discovering the key to its destruction can be a quest in and of itself.\n\n***Lonely Existence.*** From time to time, a lich might be stirred from its single-minded pursuit of power to take an interest in the world around it, most often when some great event reminds it of the life it once led. It otherwise lives in isolation, engaging only with those creatures whose service helps secure its lair.\n\nFew liches call themselves by their former names, instead adopting monikers such as the Black Hand or the Forgotten King.\n\n***Magic Collectors.*** Liches collect spells and magic items. In addition to its spell repertoire, a lich has ready access to potions, scrolls, libraries of spellbooks, one or more wands, and perhaps a staff or two. It has no qualms about putting these treasures to use whenever its lair comes under attack.\n\n***Undead Nature.*** A lich doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.\n\n***A Lich's Lair.*** A lich often haunts the abode it favored in life, such as a lonely tower, a haunted ruin, or an academy of black magic. Alternatively, some liches construct secret tombs filled with powerful guardians and traps. Everything about a lich's lair reflects its keen mind and wicked cunning, including the magic and mundane traps that secure it. Undead, constructs, and bound demons lurk in shadowy recesses, emerging to destroy those who dare to disturb the lich's work.\n\nA lich encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 22 (41,000 XP).\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lich can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; the lich can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n* The lich rolls a d8 and regains a spell slot of that level or lower. If it has no spent spell slots of that level or lower, nothing happens.\n* The lich targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. A crackling cord of negative energy tethers the lich to the target. Whenever the lich takes damage, the target must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the lich takes half the damage (rounded down), and the target takes the remaining damage. This tether lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round or until the lich or the target is no longer in the lich's lair.\n* The lich calls forth the spirits of creatures that died in its lair. These apparitions materialize and attack one creature that the lich can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (15d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. The apparitions then disappear.\n\n\\\n",

The night passes uneventfully, this time no illusions haunt the house. In the distance they hear the sounds of carriages and horses on the road.\n\nIn the morning, almost back to town, they come across four [Iron Riders](/doc/iron-riders-of-abraxas-P77pTaxjou) escorting an armored horse  cart carrying bulky cargo covered with tarps. One of the men sits atop the cart with crossbow across his lap, and one man in armor stands by watching, as two shirtless and sweating younger men dig out a wheel stuck in the mud. They friendly call out \u2018Good day citizens\u2019\n\nTharac offers to help using his barbarian strength, and while the lieutenant balks, his out of breath men welcome an extra hand. Tharac has no trouble lifting the cart up despite the obviously extremely heavy cargo, and the wheel is freed. The two young soldier introduce themselves as Enryn & Elior, and ask if the players know a good bar in town? They owe them a round!\n\nMath misremember and tells them \u201c[the Empty](/doc/the-empty-net-NwapU8Z8Za) [Goat](/doc/the-wicker-goat-695vZZb5G4)\u201d. He asks where the delivery is headed and the younger men are very excited to tell him it\u2019s going straight to the famous [Captain Eliander](/doc/eliander-fireborn-GSljW693Ga) himself!\n\nThey repeat their promise of a pint of ale, as the horses carry the cart ahead and into the town.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAcOCvlX64Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAcOCvlX64Q)\n\n# Just Rewards\n\nThe party immediately goes to claim the bounty for clearing out the house. They arrive at the [Town Council](/doc/saltmarsh-public-house-0anLgJ8olH) house in afternoon, and knock on the door. After a moment, a sunburnt and very day drunk sailor named [Herschel](/doc/herschel-lgSYbAyEFz) answers the door. He takes them into a waiting room and offers them a seat while he attempts to remember why the players are there and what he is supposed to do about it. Ring the bell? Three times? His drunken antics do not amuse the party but he does eventually summon the [Councilpersons](/doc/saltmarsh-council-8KxfpMfTQ0), as they emerge from their offices or in through the front door.\n\n ![Saltmarsh Council](/api/attachments.redirect?id=50988eef-5d91-4fd9-b9b0-8f9b7cabb184)\n\nThe party is led into a large hearing chamber with a table on an elevated platform. In the front row sits a large gnomish typing contraption, at which a very tall, lanky bald man is sitting. The Council takes their seats, with [Eda Oweland](/doc/eda-oweland-HEslJp2L08) sitting in the middle taking the gavel and calling the meeting to order. She extols the virtues of the last solstice festival and, gesturing to the party, sees that it has \u201creaped a welcome harvest.\u201d She also brings up the fact that the next festival of the seven fishes is coming up, and fundraising will begin soon. Eda is very concerned that everyone go by the proper and traditional order of speaking, and interrupts people to remind them. She asks for any Council business to be addressed. Herschel sneaks in the back, takes out a drawing pad, and begins sketching the proceedings while taking nips from his flask.\n\n[Manistrad Copperlocks](/doc/manistrad-copperlocks-W9uyiYutrl), her mining pack laying in a dirty pile on the floor behind her with her pickaxe, reads a prepared statement about how citizens should not be alarmed at the sound of explosions or sight of smoke emanating from the direction of [the mine](/doc/the-old-mine-ndIfgvk1B6). It is a planned operation.\n\nYoung blonde sailor [Anders So](/doc/anders-solmor-njTKn6ITMV)lmor says that he had 2 extremely reliable sailors vanish without a trace, and it didn\u2019t seem right. Men on the docks said something prowls and stalks at night, looking for sailors walking alone. He asks for additional guards in the dock district at night, and more torches to be distributed to area businesses. [Captain Fireborn](/doc/eliander-fireborn-GSljW693Ga) agrees.\n\nFinally, Eda invites the crowd (the party) to bring their petition to the Council. Math tells the story of how they found some weasels, some undead, some skeletons, and woo boy some mold. He leaves out the part about the smugglers and the illusionist [Sanbalet](/doc/sanbalet-Zt2T42UM2E) and the secret cave.\n\nCaptain Fireborn summons one of his guards and hands over a large bag of 200 gold pieces to the party. Math wants to know (and Eda says he must make a new petition!) what will be done with the house, and could the party be it\u2019s caretakers if it\u2019s abandoned?\n\nThere is some debate among Eda & the Captain about what the correct historical precedent is, while the other Council members mostly shrug. Suddenly the man typing on the gnomish contraption goes \u201cpssst\u201d and wanders over to the table to whisper something in Anders ear. Anders then says:\n\n\u201cAhh yes my assistant has reminded me that it should go to auction, to be held in escrow by the city, until the date and manner of sale is made public for anyone. That seems fair to me?\u201d Captain Fireborn & Eda have a little sidebar about the books they should consult to be sure, but agree: the house will be auctioned off publicly. The party is welcome to make their bid.\n\n# Flying Cargo\n\nThe party bids Herschel goodbye and heads out on to the street where it is now late afternoon. They immediately decide they should disparage the condition of the house in public as much as possible, and do so loudly everywhere they go: *the [mold](/doc/yellow-mold-d8FmuoIiKE) is really bad! And remember when we dropped the metal book through that stupid floor and then you all fell too! It\u2019s really sucks, full of weasels and shit!*\n\nThey make their way to [The Empty Net](/doc/the-empty-net-NwapU8Z8Za), in the dock district, because they want [Kreb](/doc/kreb-shenker-ya5uvzqUn9) to tell them what the hell is going on and where [2 Coin](/doc/2-coin-NSUizjoWgU) is so they can fuck him up for what he did. But as they make their way past the ships, three longshoremen are arguing and screaming at each other about a wobbly crate that is being unloaded from a ship. The two men below yell that he\u2019s going to drop, but the man wenching it down is undeterred. He does in fact lose control of it, and it tumbles to the sidewalk below, crashing and sending it\u2019s cargo flying everywhere. What looks to be furniture and other household accoutrements wrapped in moving blankets are all over the road. The men are now screaming even worse obscenities at each other.\n\nThe party approaches and notices that some of the things on the sidewalk appear to be\u2026 moving on their own. A rug unfurls itself and begins to levitate, and out of a barrel a bunch of animated books bust out of and hurl themselves as missiles toward the party. A large, gleaming sword, rises out of the rubble, and swipes to remove the head from one of the sailors mid-swear. The head rolls to the feet of Tharac, and the sword turns toward him next. The rug tries to give Krack the squeeze, and Tharac counters the sword\u2019s blow, sending it careening and broken into the water below. Krack uses [Web](/doc/web-vW8qhEOjRB) to catch the books and the rug. The books escape and fly straight to the wizard tower of [Keledek](/doc/keledek-the-wizard-jGCH5H0n7q). The party beats the rug into submission. They examine the remains of the crate, and see the customs seal of the [Longshoremen\u2019s Union of New Galmaarden](/doc/longshoremans-union-of-new-galmaarden-s29wx1YOfo).\n\nSome sailors come and carry away the body (and the head) towards the [Sailor\u2019s Temple](/doc/saltmarsh-sailors-temple-0uvkMI2jn9).\n\n# Confronting Kreb\n\nThe party enters the Empty net, which is just as shitty as the last time they were here. Krack is all fired up with her wand up her sleeve. They approach the bar, where a dwarf dressed as a clown sits, consuming shot after shot from a dusty dwarven bottle that Kreb holds in his hand, refilling over and over again for him. The dwarf is crying and looks like he hasn\u2019t slept in days. The party orders a round, and Math asks if the dwarven libation is any good. Kreb just responds \u201cHe likes it\u201d and points to the clown.\n\nThe party tells Kreb they\u2019ve been at the old alchemist\u2019s house, which raises an eyebrow from him. Krack attempts to charm him, but he just laughs and admonishes her and says, \u201cDon\u2019t try any tricks little one, aren\u2019t many I don\u2019t know.\u201d When they mention the name 2 Coin his demeanor changes, and he pulls them aside into a booth (actually half an old boat bolted on to the bar). He pulls the curtain, lights the cigar he\u2019s been chomping on, and pours everyone a drink from the foul smelling dwarf bottle. \n\n\u201c2 Coin is no friend of mine, let me put it that way\u201d he says.\n\nAfter some dodging of questions, he is interested to hear that The Sanbalet left the premises of the house with the cargo that was supposed to be delivered. Now Kreb wants to know what the party has to say.\n\n\u201c2 Coin was sent by I guess you could say the Money Man behind this business arrangement, as insurance to see that it went well. I am not at liberty to say who this man might be, but I know he will be very upset if this job is not completed. It is my job to be sure it\u2019s done, to make connections. You are enterprising young adventurers - if you do this for me, I will be sure the Money Man knows who is responsible for his good fortune.\u201d\n\nAfter more questions Kreb tells the party that if they pick up a crab boat at 6am tomorrow morning from a red hatted man by the docks, they can put their crab traps down by the Empty Net to pick up the cargo, and then deliver it to the Sea Ghost which will be docked outside the alchemist\u2019s house. Use the signals they already knew about to approach the ship. They can keep new \u201cequipment\u201d from the cargo as their payment.\n\nThey all shake hands and leave.\n\n# Cashing in that Beer\n\nNever ones to forget an open beer tab, the party goes to [The Wicker Goat](/doc/the-wicker-goat-695vZZb5G4) to find the Iron Rider\u2019s horses outside watering themselves. They go in and find the two young soldiers halfway to a hangover, and get a round and chat them up. The soldiers say it\u2019s nice to get out of [Striborg](/doc/striborg-mZk9jSyJUV)! They ask Math what part of the city he\u2019s from. When the party asks about the cargo they were carrying, Enryn starts to tell but Elior shuts him up. Krack uses [Suggestion](/doc/suggestion-pYusUQUzD5) to tell Elior to go away, and he excuses himself to pee, by walking out the door and then down the street.\n\nOrdering another round of drinks, they again press Enryn on what were they carrying? And to where? He does tell them: \u201cIt went straight to Captain Fireborn! Dude\u2019s a fucking legend! But it\u2019s so dumb because they showed us when we left - the cargo is just a bunch of safes, and they\u2019re fucking empty! This job\u2019s dumb sometimes but it\u2019s good to get out of the city!\u201d\n\n# Crabbin\u2019\n\nThe party spends the night on the hard stone beds of the Sailor\u2019s Temple again, where a vigil is being held for the decapitated longshoreman. When they awake pre-dawn in the morning, his corpse is on a bed next to them, his head still mid-swear. Krack uses [Mage Hand](/doc/mage-hand-1nhwE5UUt3) to make it fly around because she\u2019s a weirdo. Tharac leaves his great axe behind.\n\nThe party looks out the door of the temple and sees that, as discussed at the Council meeting, lots of guards with torches are on patrol around the docks. Beyond they see the man with the red hat, two piers down.\n\nThey decide to just say fuck it and pretend they\u2019re leaving the vigil late for home. They are stopped by guards, who ask them to either return indoors or show their ship\u2019s passage papers. Otherwise they must obey the curfew until sunrise. Lacking the appropriate papers, they go back to the temple and debate what to do.\n\nKrack attempts to forge one with her kit, kinda poorly. Math steals one from a sleeping sailor, who has it in his pocket. Tharac gets his glasses out and attempts to copy it. This time, they step out of the temple singing sea shanties at the top of their lungs. The guards approach and ask for papers, not really buying it but they let the party go on this time, one of the guards saying the ship they\u2019re supposedly looking for - The Fair Maiden - is down the way.\n\nThe red hatted man tells them they\u2019re late, and leaves them with a crab boat. They set off into the still dark dawn\u2026\n\n\\\n\\\n",

The worldview of hags is a mystery, but one could approximate Verid's conception of Bel as something in between child, beast, and hallucination.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBel's duties were both mundane and esoteric. Occasionally compliance was rewarded with food or a trinket, and a pat on the head, but more often with riddles or incomprehensible ramblings. Failures were never to be forgotten; Verid carved her reprimands in runes upon his carapace.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBel's situation changed when he was seven years old. A group of local villagers had grown tired of Verid's torment and secured help from the [Iron Riders](/doc/iron-riders-of-abraxas-P77pTaxjou). In the early hours, an armed band sneaked into Verid's den and slew her. Bel, who had been caged during the murder, was taken into custody. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWord of the turtle child's liberation found the ear of warden [Cestian Garindollo](/doc/cestian-garindollo-9ky29l68Kg). Cestian saw an opportunity; that by adopting the exotic child, he and his wife would gain status among their peers as humanitarians (Lady Ysferonde had successfully performed the stunt with an elf orphan, much to Lady Isbin's chagrin). The gesture was misguided. Isbin thought Bel was monstrous and demanded he be disposed. Luckily for Bel, their daughter Devogine adored him. Isbin acceded to Bel\u2019s residency with a multitude of requirements. Devogine renamed him Belsifer.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor the rest of his childhood, Belsifer enjoyed luxuries of wealth: a safe home, fine meals, education, and a playmate. However, it was clear that their generosity was contingent on service, and his presence in the family was to remain secret.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Devogine came of age and left home, Belsifer was without advocate. Promptly, arrangements were made for him to join rank at the Temple of Selune. There, he found acceptance, respect, and purpose. He devoted himself entirely to the Moon Goddess and vowed never again to serve another mortal.\n\n\\\n",

      "content": "# *The Grey Hat Rogue of Striborg*\n\n## Character Sheet\n\n<https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/77266767>\n\n\\\n## Background\n\nGreyson Adams was born to a merchant family of modest means, but while they had a roof over their head it was in constant danger of collapsing. A clever child, Greyson became jealous of the more wealthy families around him. He found it easy, and perhaps even thrilling, to hustle and swindle the unwitting elite who were never suspicious of the smiling lad with a tucked-in shirt and combed hair.\n\nGreyson\u2019s fun came to an abrupt end when one day he swiped the wrong box and accidentally caused a death. He swore he would never steal again, but after years in the family business he could not find the same rush of adrenaline doing anything else. He loved the thrill of the chase, the heightening of senses when you were somewhere you weren\u2019t allowed to be. Greyson delighted in both the puzzles of locks and the puzzles of the human mind. He began to study and practice with locks, using his connections to different merchants to secure tools of both a legal and illicit nature.\n\nThese days, Greyson only steals to prove that he can, but never actually takes anything. Like catch-and-release, he\u2019s in it for the sport. On occasion he will be hired by merchants or banks to break in as a method of testing their security. He has neither the patience for the cushy life, nor the stomach for a life of crime, and so lives between those worlds as a grey-hat rogue.\n\nGreyson lives by his own personal code of conduct in regards to his thieving. First, he never steals anything from someone of less means than himself. Second, he only steals when necessary to right a moral wrong. Third, if he does something he considers to be against his personal code, he does something good in exchange to set the balance of the universe right again.\n\nGreyson was turned into a vampire, or rather a dampyr, by Amelia, whom was later (barely) defeated by the party. At odds with his normally righteous self, Greyson begins to sense a moral ambiguity in the balance of the world from his extreme experiences as an adventurer.\n\nAfter spending so much time in Duskmeyer, at the heart of the magic of ancient Avalon, Greyson awoke to find a patch of obsidian dragon scales on his shoulder and beginning to run down his right arm. Feeling a pulse of wild energy, the abberant dragonmark allowed him to begin to channel some of the wild magic for his own use. \u201cwer zezhuanth iri jinthil\u201d He recalls from Dragonborn lore. \u201cThe ancient ones remember\u201d.\n\n\\\n\\\n",

As the roads got steeper and snow began to cover the ground, you began to see small crimson flowers starkly and defiantly poking up through the white ice. You knew that as long as those flowers bloomed, the pass was said to be safe for travel. You put your trust in those flowers and followed them up the mountain, letting them be your guide, past the village of [Jhaampe](/doc/jhaampe-mCxU5WAN7q) and up the treacherous path to the [monastery](/doc/the-khaneye-jun-fan-6tqXbPVyii).\\n\\nAnother memory, years later. Looking out your now dead mentor [Atashi\u2019](/doc/atashi-atVd38Z9vD)s window overlooking the gardens of the monastery where those same red flowers are grown and tended by the brothers. You sigh as you begin your first day assuming your former master\u2019s duties. You sit down at his desk, take out his ledger, and flip through the pages of his familiar handwriting. You naturally stop on one page, and a small note falls out. Written in his hand you see his final message to you -  **\u201cBahruhn - beware!\u201d**\\n\\nYou flip over the note and see the drawing of a symbol\u2026.\n\n\n:::info\nBahruhn drew [Two of Wands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_of_Wands)\n\n:::\n\nThe party hears screaming from the arboretum room to the east: \n\n*\u201dTICKLECORN!!!! OH GOD NO STOP!!! HELPP! TICKLECORN!!*\u201d\n\n[Meepo](/doc/meepo-UMrKyHk53I) is in trouble! The party readies their weapons, and throws open the door.\n\n# Morbid Arboretums\n\n### East\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=173afbfd-2a78-49e7-ba9b-02545e6c3016 \"right-50 =240x315\")This room is thick with humidity. In the mist, the party sees various species of [Underdark](/doc/underdark-Lu1sEFgEWw) plant specimens being grown in neat rows. In the back corner, two [briar children](/doc/child-of-the-briar-sI5pUsj9VA) have entangled Meepo in a mess of thorny vines. One has a knife and is stabbing him as the other punches him every time he screams.\n\nThe party rushes in to fight back and is ambushed by another that shoots thorns from it\u2019s mouth. All surrounded in the small, damp arboretum Bahruhn pulls back and takes cover, dodging more spat thorns. He lights a torch and sees fear in the briar children\u2019s eyes. Intimidation not being effective on these creatures, he sets them to flame while the party grabs Meepo free, who is also on fire. They use their jug of never-ending water to douse him.\n\nMeepo tells them that he wants to win back his pride, prove his bravery to his clan. Whatever evil is in this place, Meepo wants to fight it. The party takes him in, and Ama casts [Tiny Hut](/doc/leomunds-tiny-hut-Nbn6HCph7L) to protect the party as they rest.\n\n### North\n\nThey proceed north, into another octagon arboretum. In this room, crates are stacked to the ceiling containing [Sapphire Nightshade](/doc/sapphire-nightshade-Qvbjiqksvy) flowers as if prepared for market. Butterflies aimlessly flit about the room. Bahruhn presses a flower into his notebook, but inhales some of the pollen has a flashback to a shameful memory from his childhood: *being the poorest family in a poor village, the shame of being hungry.*\n\nThe only door from here is to the south east, and they take it.\n\nIn a room lit by dim magic red light, they find a statue of a [Dragon Emperor](/doc/dragon-empire-odzVqtQPbm) with empty eye sockets. A circle of draconic runes is inlaid in the floor (Bahruhn translates) *\u201dLet the sorcerous power illuminate my spirit*\u201d. They don\u2019t like the sound of that. Meepo uses [Stone Shape](/doc/stone-shape-Ni4NXltKR3) to reconfigure the statue as his queen, [Yusdrayl](/doc/yusdrayl-JyU80S0S6K).\n\n### Library\n\nThey continue north into a library, and pick from amongst the tattered piles of tomes a few spell scrolls and a book of draconic lore - this [Emperor is Ashardalon](/doc/ashardalon-tpAzsPflZX), the one who codified slavery of the dragonborn. This temple exists to exalt her power.\n\n### Myconid Basement\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=03b1488f-f72f-4342-aee5-bb62d909bbaa \"left-50\")They continue following a passage underneath the North Arboretum. This place is thick with spore and the smell of decaying flesh. They see several decaying corpses of past adventurers subsumed by giant mushrooms. They poke one of these humanoids and in a raspy voice it expels spores, *\u201dMadness and evil leaks from this place\u2026 turn back before it\u2019s too late\u2026*\u201d The party pulls a [Longsword of the Draconic Empire](/doc/longsword-of-the-dragon-empire-WNp5oBATI3) from it\u2019s grasp and attempts to question this rotting thing. *\u201cWe were hunted\u2026 the master and his hounds\u2026\u201d* It is not much help, but nearby they find a vellum map of what appears to be the Dreadwood with an `X` marking [Duskmire](/doc/duskmire-hJey19lfsu).\n\n# The Dark Druid\u2019s Quarters\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=66876668-1a17-45f8-8132-7ac294a0c2e9 \"full-width\")They continue down a long dark hallway and find two doors. One is locked, Grey kicks it in. Inside they find a study with many records tacked to the wall and strewn over the desk - harvest statistics, measurements of water, details of shipments - the operations of a large farm. Searching through the desk and shelves, they find a few spell scrolls of Entangle and Remove Poison and also another interesting looking book, bound in dragon scale leather. Eagerly opening it, Bahruhn unfortunately triggers a [Glyph of Warding](/doc/glyph-of-warding-QlcSBRrKoQ) and everyone is knocked to their feet in the explosion.\n\nContinuing through the next door, they find a chamber with the southern wall collapsed. Beyond, it leads into a massive cavern that glows with an unnatural purple light that has become familiar\u2026\n\n# The Grove\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=839b0474-3745-441a-be05-d1ffa6d477fd)\n\nRow upon row of Sapphire Nightshade are being grown in this cavern, luminescent fungi have fully populated the ceiling and cast light downwards to sickly seductive plants. Butterflies flit about everywhere. Dragonborn ghosts and poltergeists, bound in manacles and chains, work the field.\n\nAma pulls out her [Collector of Souls](/doc/collector-of-souls-XA0hpJ7gfE) and sets to freeing the dragonborn workers. As she moves about the flowers, she is overcome by their psychedelic effects. The others see her lose touch with just a reality for a moment\u2026\n\n> Drogarius \"Dro\" Edwardian Vitorio Vardendale walks up to Ama and touches her face. \u201cMy love, I have never forgotten you and have finally found you\u2026\u201d she initially resists but \u201cI have come to ask you for forgiveness\u2026\u201d\n\nAma turns back to the others as if nothing happened.\n\nThen they hear the howl of a wolf. Several howls.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=6a9d81dd-f624-44e9-ab86-75c5b3b1417d \"left-50\")Looking into the distance of the cavern they see a giant black tree growing out of stone ruins of some structure.They begin to move deeper into the grove towards it when they are ambushed by [Dire Wolves](/doc/dire-wolf-Vedxigkw0u). The party fights them off before they are able to gain advantage with their size and pack tactics.\n\nBut as they tussle with the dogs, the antlered Knight of Night appears, removing his hood and showing his face as a young [Lamont Solmar](/doc/lamont-solmar-GLrWBoIX5h) that Grey immediately recognizes. His patron - the master who used to meet him in Burle for an ale and updates on the condition of his hunting lodge that Grey checked in on. Come to think of it, the ruins here are the exact layout of the old hunting lodge\u2026 Grey recognizes this place as well\u2026\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=419f7833-1573-4038-a367-15641b67feed \"full-width\")A [humanoid figure with a skeletal bird](/doc/lukas-woodenkeeper-MFwbJrVzOB) on their shoulder stands next to Lamont, who whispers something in his ear. The figure goes to a large, inset door in the wood of the great tree, opens it, and disappears inside.\n\nThis fell vampire transforms into a mist and moves deftly around the players, flying about the grove and taking opportunistic attacks. They chase him up a small hill, to where a dark and twisted tree grows out of the ruins. With the players closing in, the vampire transforms himself into the image of Bahruhn\u2019s old mentor, [Atashi](/doc/atashi-atVd38Z9vD). He leans and drinks Bahruhn\u2019s blood, sucking his life from him. Using his charm the vampire commands Bahruhn to \u201cspill his blood on the tree\u201d and the obedient student does so.\n\nAt this point in the epic battle, the dire wolves have fallen and the vampire Lamont stands alone. He takes damage from their magical weapons, and his shapeshifting and charms aren\u2019t enough.\n\nGrey climbs up the tree after him, and sinks his magical Moon Touched sword into the vampire, letting loose a lot of blood. That\u2019s when Meepo jumps in with his darts, landing the final blow that kills the monster.\n\nGrey takes his sword and beheads the vampire\u2019s body, throwing the corpse to the base of the tree.\n\nThe Knight of Night is dead.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=fdb1f355-4a3c-4f1e-86f7-c2756d42f187 \" =273x273\")\n\n# Photos\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=d2acb148-c479-476b-9c1e-465b033cbe16) ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=0a2f107f-2cb2-4acf-9182-29624c74895d) ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=80a32e32-a708-4064-8be5-31c65c1ee3cc) ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=49b422ef-97cd-4de5-983c-36812b2c036e) ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=4f39efcb-3eda-4393-9d60-4a27625ef43c) ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=eb7bda11-4029-449b-9e41-09a62e76b1f9) ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=85d4c978-bdb9-4936-8814-64f50755e27e)",

If the target can see or hear the horror, the target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target becomes paralyzed until the end of its next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the horror's Maddening Presence for the next 24 hours.\n\n## Skittering Horror\n\n***Horrors and Madness.*** Horrors on Ravnica are terror and madness personified. You can represent this reality by using the madness rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide.\n\nWhenever a character fails a saving throw against the flying horror's Frightening Screech, the shadow horror's claw attack, or the skittering horror's Maddening Presence, note that fact. At the end of the encounter, have each character who failed at least one of those saving throws make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, nothing happens. On a failed save, a character gains a form of madness from the Dungeon Master's Guide, with the severity depending on how many of the saving throws that character failed during the encounter, as shown on the Madness Severity table.\n\n##### Madness Severity\n\n| Failed Saves | Madness |\n|:---:|----|\n| 1 | Short-term |\n| 2-3 | Long-term |\n| 4+ | Indefinite |\n\n***Horrors.*** Terrifying evils stalk, fly, and scuttle in the dark corners of Ravnica, from the depths of the undercity to the blackest parts of the night sky. Collectively, these creatures are called horrors-a variety of things that lurk in the dark and embody the deepest fears of Ravnica's people. All are evil creatures with dim reason and preternatural cunning.\n\nAt least three guilds have been known to compel horrors into service. For House Dimir, horrors spread fear and despair in the citizenry and carry out assassinations or kidnappings against well-protected targets. For the Cult of Rakdos, horrors are simply one more weapon in an arsenal of terrifying and shock-inspiring creatures that might appear on stage. For the Golgari Swarm, horrors scavenge the sewers and protect the guild's territory.\n\nHouse Dimir uses all three base kinds of horrors. The Cult of Rakdos prefers shadow horrors, and the Golgari Swarm uses skittering horrors.\n\n***Customizing a Horror.*** Horrors share some common body types but vary wildly in other characteristics. A particular horror's form might incorporate elements that resemble fiendish, insectile, or reptilian features. To customize a horror, choose a base creature (flying horror, shadow horror, or skittering horror), then roll once on the Primary Features table and once on the Secondary Features table (or choose an option from each table). Add those features to the base creature.\n\n##### Primary Features\n\n| d4 | Feature |\n|:---:|----|\n| 1 | Avoidance. If the horror is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails. |\n| 2 | Damage Resistances. The horror has resistance to necrotic and psychic damage. |\n| 3 | Innate Spellcasting. The horror's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13 for flying horror, DC 16 for shadow horror, and DC 17 for skittering horror). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: 3/day: *darkness* 1/day each: *fear* (shadow horror and skittering horror only), *phantasmal killer* (skittering horror only) |\n| 4 | Psychic Rebuke. When the horror takes damage from a melee attack, it can use its reaction to emit psychic energy within a 5-foot radius. Each creature in that area takes 3 (1d6) psychic damage (flying horror), 7 (2d6) psychic damage (shadow horror), or 10 (3d6) psychic damage (skittering horror). |\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Source: [GGR](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#skittering%20horror_ggr) \n\n[https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#skittering%20horror%5Fggr](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#skittering%20horror%5Fggr)\n\n\\\n",

The [Dreadwood](/doc/dreadwood-GcfKdBzGyT) forest looms, its dense canopy turning day into dusk. Each step you take forward is met with the crunch of dead leaves and the distant, ominous sounds of unseen creatures stirring in the underbrush. The air is thick with the scent of loam and decay - vines and thorns grasp at your clothing like desperate hands, as if the very woods themselves wish to prevent your passage. Yet, with the temple's secrets in your wake, you push forward deeper into the darkness, where you know somewhere ahead lies safety in the town of [Burle](/doc/burle-8ZuZ4qZsXt).\n\nThe party takes a faint game trail through the woods as they debate what to do - call the guildsmen, or return to the Temple? Greyson can\u2019t let go of the pleas of the entombed [Estelar](/doc/estelar-the-heretic-OtEcj9hL0Z) they left behind, but Grey is still convinced that not letting whatever soul was in that sarcophagus was the right move. As they discuss this, they come upon a a friendly gnome wizard ahead on the path. The wizard [Rado](/doc/rado-robbys-character-khfSywxKIF) introduces himself as looking for adventure, and Greyson seizes on this opportunity to point out that if they had a wizard\u2019s help, they could more easily determine whether they should free Estelar. \n\nThe party decides to head back, and begins their descent into the lightless temple, passing once again by the gallows and mountain of dragonborn skulls. Grey had the foresight to bring some small trees which they use to bridge the traps they previously uncovered. Making their way through the silent halls, they once again stand before the sarcophagus of Estelar.\n\nInside, the voice pleads, *\u201dYou have returned! Yes, free me and end my torment!*\u201d\n\nRado performs his ritual to [detect magic](/doc/detect-magic-eyp2IwEbpj) and unfortunately informs the party that there is some sort of illusion at work here. This only fortifies Grey\u2019s resolve, and he backs away from it as Greyson decides to crack it open anyways.\n\nAn ancient looking elf sits up in the tomb, *\u201dThank you my friends - finally I can be free of this magic. I will always be with you\u2026\u201d* as the elven form says this it\u2019s corporeal body falls apart before their eyes, first dissolving to nothing but bone and then with his last word his bones turning to dust in the wind.\n\nReaching inside the tomb, they find a [Helm of Comprehend Languages](https://5e.tools/items.html#helm%20of%20comprehending%20languages_dmg) adorned with elvish symbols, and a shortsword \"the [Dragon Slayer](https://5e.tools/items/dragon-slayer-dmg.html)\u201d.\n\n# The Guildsmen\n\nMaking the long trek back up the staircase to the surface again, the party finds it is late afternoon. They decide to call the guildsmen to help them navigate back, and Greyson pulls out his Sending Stone.\n\n> With a sudden ripple in the air, the quiet of the Dreadwood is broken by the magic portal emerging from a swirl of energy, casting an eerie glow upon the undergrowth. As the portal stabilizes, [Saxton](/doc/saxton-pope-CJaIQ4Kkdw) and [Eldan](/doc/eldan-fletcher-QWyA10eG7I) step through confidently, their figures silhouetted against the pulsating light. The magical portal snaps shut behind them with a soft whoosh, leaving no trace of their supernatural entrance but the lingering scent of ozone in the air. \u201cYou called?\u201d Saxton said, looking bemused. Eldan looks you over with the eyes of a careful ranger.\n\nThe guildsmen look the party over, \u201cWell, you\u2019re in one piece. Best we get going before it gets dark, there have been attacks recently\u2026 displacer beasts\u2026\u201d\n\nThey begin heading down a trail when a hare bounds out in front of them, and in the fading twilight an owl swoops down to grab it and fly off with it\u2019s prey. They come to a fork in the road with sign pointing \u201cBurle \u2192\u201d but the guildsmen confidently take the opposite path. \u201cYou can never retrace your steps in these woods. Also, people keep changing the signs\u2026\u201d\n\nAs night falls the Guildsmen get noticeably more tense, and draw their weapons and light torches, the light penetrating very little in the dark wood. They come to a clearing, a meadow with a stone well. \u201cWe\u2019ll camp here tonight and leave at first light.\u201d Both Saxton and Eldran begin setting up tents, starting a fire, and unpacking the beginnings of a hearty stew. As they begin these preparations, Greyson sets up their Ropey of Climbing to encircle the camp and act as an alarm. Noticing the guildsmen nervousness earlier, the party debates whether they should keep a watch as well. Overhearing their discussion, Saxton insists, \u201cYou can stay up if you want but you\u2019re paying us for doing it, you might as well get some rest tonight.\u201d \n\nSettling down in their sleeping bags, Greyson sleeps with one eye open. In the middle of the night, he awakes to find something slimy slowly oozing across his face\u2026. it\u2019s a tiny [briar child](/doc/child-of-the-briar-sI5pUsj9VA), riding a snail like a slow motion horse. He looks down into Greyson\u2019s face and whispers, *\u201dTRUST NO ONE!\u201d* as he very slowly rides off into the darkness.\n\n# The Owl Harpy\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=0f7c896d-3fa5-41ed-9543-48224cd4b715)In the darkest part of the night, the party is awoken by the most beautiful song they\u2019ve ever heard.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8mFXhgtwtk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8mFXhgtwtk)\n\nThey open their eyes to find it absolutely pitch black. But they feel drawn to the sound of the voice, so sweet in this dreadful place. They all find themselves leaving their sleeping bags, yearning to be closer to whatever being blessed them with it\u2019s song.\n\nAs they almost sleepwalk towards it\u2019s source, both Bahruhn and Saxton see [a sticky ooze](/doc/sap-ooze-eGVX8QPLEh) moving a little too quickly down the nearby trees. The ooze forms into a ball, and then into a more upright human form, lunging out at the passing humans, but unable to sway them from their slow march towards what they can now see as the magical blackness dissipates\u2026. an [owl harpy](/doc/owl-harpy-xYMZ35KrBO) perched in a tree, wings spread as it projects it\u2019s song into the night.\n\nStarting to snap out of their magical induced fog, the party fights back but has trouble hitting the flying monster. The harpy cannot outfly Rado\u2019s magic missiles, but one of the oozes manages to overpower Bahruhn, forcing itself down his throat and then dominating him into fighting with his more solid form against the others. Rado goes down as the others hack the parasitic sap oozes into sticky messes. Finally getting control of the terrain, the party launches their assault on the harpy and ends it\u2019s song.\n\nThe party turns to the guildsmen, who were surprisingly not effective and frankly look terrified at the sight of the monster\u2026.\n\n# Back to Burle\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=7846a363-8328-4fe1-8d1d-ae70af0e4084)\n\nWith the morning\u2019s thin tendrils of light barely making their way through the Dreadwood\u2019s canopy, Saxton attempts to regain his composure. \u201cAlright well, time to get on with it.\u201d He walks over to the well and draws up a bucket of water, drenching in Eldran who disappears as the water cascades to the ground. One by one, the party follows and they all are transported with a nauseous lurch back to the main street of Burle.\n\nSaxton turns to them and says, \u201cIt\u2019s been wonderful traveling with you folks, but we have much to attend to at the guild house. Stop by for a beer, and you\u2019re welcome to take your lodgings there.\u201d\n\nThe party decides to take care of unfinished business, first they head to the ancient treant at the center of town. They notice that it\u2019s leaves are no longer raining down and it even looks a tad more sturdy since they were last hear. Placing their hands on the ancient being, they ask questions about the Dreadwood and where is Duskmire? But they receive only riddles in return.\n\n> \"Chains that bind, but not in sight, held in darkness, away from light. What guards the pact with silent screams, in the depths of nightmares, not dreams?\"\n\nand\n\n> Veins of power, hidden from sight, weave through the land, basked in twilight. They hold this wood in a tight embrace, yet can mislead with a gentle grace\u2026.\n\n ![Surly Bartender - Jorin](/api/attachments.redirect?id=c2533b8a-0fd4-493d-a794-ab8aa24ce260 \"right-50 =1024x364\")The echoing and rumbling voice of the treant does not offer the much clarity. They decide it\u2019s time for a beer and to settle their bets. They make the walk back to the [Longhouse](/doc/burle-longhouse-VdIuRMv8yi) where merchants and alemasters hawk their wares. In the smoky corner of a tarpaulin covered alley, they find a surly bartender who does not introduce himself but launches straight into, \u201cWaddaya want?\u201d when they complain about his prices, he waters down a beer in front of them and asks, \u201cIs that better??\u201d\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=92e06e34-eb82-4b4a-b1e1-04d5331ad4ae \"left-50\")They sit down and have a beer with some dice players - a young elfmarked woman and a dragonborn named Iron. [Iron](/doc/iron-XjradLKM25) is wearing noble clothes, although very dirty. Over some dice rolls, the party asks them about the guild and if there are any other authorities in Burle. He tells them, in fact he just signed up with the guild as a recruit - he wants to avenge his family that died in the sahuagin invasion of Saltmarsh. Learning his association, the party leaves the dice and ale behind to search for items in the market\u2026\n\n# The Letter\n\nAs the party leaves, they hear a booming baritone voice behind them. \u201cMaster Greyson, I presume?\u201d A huge bear-man is towering over them, elegantly dressed in his purple cloak embroidered with silver horses. \u201cI am [Bohran](/doc/bohran-xP2jMXZLXo), of the [Night Messengers](/doc/night-messengers-1lb9etph9O). I have been contracted to deliver this missive to you sir.\u201d He hands Greyson a wax sealed letter.\n\n> Master Greyson,\n>\n> \\\n> Everything is going great here at the **[Gold Scale Co ](/doc/gold-scale-company-m1WdlmIYwP)**in your absence - I have included your share of the month\u2019s profit. *(235 gold)*\n>\n> The bar fills up early these days as no one wants to be on the roads near Saltmarsh at night anymore. In town, our mutual acquaintance Mr. [Daniel Warrington](/doc/commodore-daniel-warrington-OHzOMkhMHS) is no longer Lieutenant, but now Commodore, taking the rank of his late father. Despite the expanded [Iron Riders](/doc/iron-riders-of-abraxas-P77pTaxjou) presence the sahuagin still walk the streets at night unchallenged in our beleaguered town\u2026\n>\n> \\\n> I send other news, gossip really, of something I overheard here at the bar that may be of use to you\u2026 a very drunk gentleman (*forgive me, I may have overserved him!*) told a meandering story about how people kept disappearing in Burle. Supposedly, their souls are sold to the sorceress of the forest by the [guildsmen](/doc/burle-hunters-guild-TFqCs3pSJy) there for good hunting favor. I would not usually believe a word of this, as many who drown their sorrows in ale tell wild tales\u2026 but whatever the truth of it - the fear in his eyes was real.\n>\n> Be careful out there -\u00a0\n>\n> [Gregorio](/doc/gregorio-XvYkj4xTZI)\n\nBohran bows as deeply as his hulking form will allow, and touches the brooch holding his cloak around his shoulders. The shadows themselves swirl and take corporeal form in a black horse, which Bohran mounts and rides toward the gate.\n\n# Conspiracies\n\n ![Iron](/api/attachments.redirect?id=a2284b12-a458-4ce4-b4b3-a8fc88b64190 \"right-50\")The party parlays outside of the earshot of the bar they just left. Should they trust the guildsmen? Where should they put up for the night?\n\nThe two mothers wander past, pressing a familiar flyer into their hands: *Have you seen our kids?*\n\nThe party tells them the bad news, that their children are probably dead and that the guildsmen never intended to help them. Speaking in a close whisper, one of the mothers said, \u201cWe suspected\u2026 we found one of their ex members to help us\u2026 you should speak to him.. meet him at the great tree - bring an offering and he will find you.\u201d\n\nBahruhn buys an orange - their signal. The party splits, with the others seeking accommodation and Bahruhn setting off on his own to meditate, as monks do. As he turns the corner, he catches the Iron - the dragonborn they were just talking to in the bar - slowly following the rest of the party at a distance\u2026.\n\nHe approaches the great awakened tree again, seeing it slumber. Several locals are gathered at an altar, lighting candles and praying to their forest sentinel. He places the orange on the altar, and bends his head to meditate. He soon feels a presence next time. *\u201cGood evening friend\u201d*\n\n> You don't know what you're stepping into, do you? The guild, this town... there's a darkness beneath it all, deeper than the Dreadwood itself. I've seen it, been a part of it against my will.

To dwarves, Durandar is a holy city where they build an underground kingdom to sustain them through the apocalypse that [King Olfgard Wisebeard](/doc/king-olfgard-wisebeard-S0YDu9xGHy) foretold in his prophecy.\n\nThe dwarves here believe strongly that many (but not all) magical practice is forbidden. Despite this taboo, they make wide use of various druidic, alchemical, and clerical magic that has practical or life-sustaining uses. What is strictly forbidden in dwarven culture is warlock or demon pacts, wizardy that runs counter to life like necromancy, and any magical discipline seen as outside dwarven history.\n\n## Organization\n\nThe dwarven kingdom is ruled by a King and is served by a Council of advisors, made up of the various heads of the dwarven guilds. Most of society is organized by guild, with occupations usually passed down along family clan lines. Dwarves take their loyalty to their king, guild, and clan (in that order) very seriously.\n\n### Known Kings\n\n* **King Durradin:** Established [a great forge](/doc/the-old-mine-ndIfgvk1B6) in the area known as [Saltmarsh](/doc/saltmarsh-GkGI6ISio5) in ancient times, it used a powerful crystal to render powerful magic items. The mine was ultimately abandoned and the fate of the dwarves there unknown.\n* **[King Olfgar Wisebeard](/doc/king-olfgard-wisebeard-S0YDu9xGHy)**: Revered as the Prophet-King, led the Great Dwarven Migration and founded Durandar, steering his people towards a new era of technological innovation to prepare for a prophesied apocalypse.\n* **King Borin Fireheart**: Known for his fiery temperament and unyielding dedication to technological progress, King Borin focused on expanding Durandar's industrial capabilities, especially in metalworking and steam engineering by constructing the great dam.\n* **Queen Helga Strongwill**: A rare female ruler in dwarven history, Queen Helga is known for her diplomatic skills and efforts to build alliances with other species and kingdoms. She negotiated trade rights with the [Striborg](/doc/striborg-mZk9jSyJUV) government, & entered into the current arrangement.\n\n### Guilds\n\n* [Arkwrights Guild](/doc/arkwrights-guild-xpUNyD7GMm)\n* Guild of Esteemed Artificers & Craftdwarves\n* Holy Order of Fire Keepers\n* Feastmasters of the Forge\n* Earthvein Engineer Corps\n* Merchants of the Pact\n* Brotherhood of Alesmiths\n\n## Economy\n\nThe dwarves of Durandar are renowned for their craftsmanship. They use the underground rivers and the great fires of their forges to use steam in ingenious ways, making alloys and artifacts of great quality and power that have no rivals in the world. The Arkwrights grow rare and beautiful plants and specimens which are used as raw materials by the craft guilds, which are then distributed by Merchants of the Pact who abide by the strict trade & export tax agreements the city is under.\n\nThe dammed waters of Durandar flow out of the mountain forges to the Azure Sea through the Strait of [Striborg](/doc/striborg-mZk9jSyJUV), which is controlled by the [Striborg Navy](/doc/striborg-navy-ndvIs6jZtX). Durandian goods are therefore heavily taxed, but they do not have much of a choice as their access to the sea is limited. It is rumored that many goods are smuggled out and sold in [New Galmaarden](/doc/new-galmaarden-03tcpxxc2t), although officially the Kingdom can\u2019t risk it\u2019s relationship with it\u2019s human neighbors in Striborg.",

As the party approaches the tavern, they see several citizens out enjoying the fine evening with some ale in the beer garden and porch. When they see them approaching, several stand up from their drinks looking concerned: \u201cHail friend, do you need aid? Who is that with you? Are you ok?\u201d\n\nZhilwad steps forward and explains that it is their friends birthday, and he has imbibed too much. Hearing that, the revelers raise their glasses and give it no more thought. But as they walk towards the door of the establishment, it flies open and a very aggrieved, mustachioed barkeep [Gregorio](/doc/gregorio-XvYkj4xTZI) - draped in his coat of many colors and feathered hat - throws aside his chef\u2019s jacket and demands: *\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?

He directs them into a back pantry full of barrels and other bulk foodstuffs. Nav is eager to get to work interrogating this guy but Gregorio is not having it \u201cIf he remembers, he\u2019ll kill us all. I know someone who can help! Hold on!\u201d\n\nGregorio takes out [a dark amulet](/doc/mildreds-amulet-rEyfbZD2MW) and whispers quietly into it: *Mildred! Mildred! [MILDRED](/doc/mildred-magpie-y6vemFK5Bi)!*\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=937915de-0ba1-466a-a901-bec6e1c79055 \"right-50 =338x372\")One of the barrel top flies off, and mud pours out on to the floor. A hag, covered in moss and forest detritus appears out of it. \u201cOoooooh! Yes, Gregorio, you call? And you have friends? Oh my, what can I do for you?\u201d Gregorio says, \u201cI think my friends may be in need of one of your special potions.\u201d\n\nThe hag Mildred proposes that she give everyone a tincture that will send the party \u201cinto his psyche, where he cannot lie and will not remember your questions.\u201d The fine print in her contract states that if they fail, Mildred gets their souls. \u201cSorry just boilerplate, no problem.\u201d and strikes it when Zhilwad and the others object. \n\n> \u201cI do have one price.

One of the questions is mine, I want to know: ***COMMODORE, WHERE IS YOUR CHILD?***\\n\\nI send you there, you ask my question and yours, and the Commodore will be clueless\u201d\n\nNav is immediately put off by this feral being, and uses her Divine Sense. She divines that this hag is not actually evil, but chaotic. \n\nNot knowing what else to do with the now-recovering-consciousness Commodore, they agree. Mildred takes out a strange purple crystal and shaves off a few flecks into a shot glass for the Commodore.\n\nThey all take him back to the bar and pretend to be celebrating the Commodore\u2019s birthday. Gregorio pours everyone the tincture, and they do a shot.\n\n# Something\u2019s Eating the Commodore\n\nThe party immediately feels a strange effect come over them, their vision fades into a kaleidoscope of colors. The bar begins to melt around them. They give in and spiral into themselves.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=62b5f6c7-0a5d-4e5f-ae3f-628a7a0b3266)\n\nThe party opens their eyes and finds themselves in a dark, humid place. Nav & Bertrand light torches and look around - they seem to be a corridor made of flesh, lined with rib bones, pulsating with life, their boots squishing into the sticky floor beneath them. They peek their torch into a side room and find it full of gurgling, acid that smells like\u2026 stomach acid? Folwin levitates his disembodied form into the room and sees several bones floating among the muck\u2026 and also something shiny. Zhilwad sends over his mage hand and plucks out some kind of whip made of ectoplasm. Only Folwin can see it though.\n\nContinuing onward, they pass through some kind of door-sphincter and trudge into several large patches of foul smelling oozes. Not just ordinary waste though, they come to life and attack the party in the most disgusting way possible. They overcome with the stench, Folwin vomits, and the others are nearly poisoned by it. They strike at them, and Bertrand transforms, but unfortunately in his rage decides to chomp down on one of these disgusting beasts. He kills it, but at what cost? The others feel sick. Soon a plasmoid being comes along, shimmering white, and announces, \u201cThe intruders must be expelled! Get out of here you disgusting foreign bodies!\u201d The party defeats these strange beings. ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=0e8d52d0-0fcc-4f09-bed8-c921bf5ac64e \"right-50\")\n\nZhilwad advances through the intestine-like passage, sneaking ahead, and finds a [large maggot](/doc/larva-ZoR77gyLWW) the size of a dog with the Commodore\u2019s head on it. At first, he thinks he has found the Commodore, until he sees 3 more identical little worm-people writhing around. \u201cHey! Hey you! You have to send a message to the brain! The infection is winning! We need reinforcements in here!\u201d\n\nThe worm thing nods it\u2019s very Commodore shaped head towards a terrible hole in the wall, a giant wound, dripping black blood and smelling foul. Through the damaged tissue they see more of the plasmoids and maggots fighting off a deranged, massive infected blood elemental - who is tearing at the tissue, fouling everything around them.\n\nThe party tells the strange worm things that they will do so, if they can tell them where to find the brain.\n\n# The Brain\n\nContinuing down the narrowing, fleshy corridor the party feels the wind pull at them and they are thrown forward, as if by a sneeze, and go flying through a metal door and land in darkened metal room. Lining the walls all around them are cylindrical tubes holding various people floating serenely in a green goo.\n\nThe party looks inside one and sees a man who looks like the Commodore, but older. The others contain more people, all normal looking - a priest, a woman in a red dress.\n\nThey decide to crack one open and start with the old man.\n\nOut tumbles a portly, bearded man wearing the uniform of a [Striborg Navy](/doc/striborg-navy-ndvIs6jZtX) officer. Screaming at the part at the top of his lungs, he bellows: \u201cBOY! You\u2019ll never amount to anything! You were a huge disappointment to me! You\u2019ll never be a soldier of any consequence!\u201d\n\nThe party attempts to talk to him, but he just responds as if they are children.\n\nIn the next, a religious school teacher wearing the sign of [Abraxas](/doc/abraxas-uKXAkU30vX). \u201cYou are so stupid, the only reason you\u2019re even here is because of who your father is!!\u201d\n\nIn the next, a very pretty woman: \u201cYou forgot our anniversary! Daniel, how could you? You\u2019re no good just like everyone says!\u201d she says as she cries.\n\nThe party does not like these vibes and continues onward, finding a place to rest for a while. Folwin makes chopped cheese sandwiches for everyone.\n\nMaking their way through a corridor they come to a pool of dark water with a small bridge over it. Bertrand goes first, but the bridge is an illusion. He falls into the water and is beset by terrible thoughts and whispers of disappointments past. \n\nFortunately the make it past safely - and find the brain sitting in a giant vat of similar liquid.\n\nZhilwad takes the form of the Commodore\u2019s father and approaches the brain to ask the three questions.\n\n**Where is the child?** *I left him with the wolverines in the Dreadwood\u2026 until my transformation was done\u2026*\n\n**What are you doing with the sahuagin?** He tells them that the sahuagin are keeping pirates out and allowing ship traffic in under his approval, freeing his men up to pursue other matters and expand the Riders control of the area.\n\n**Who transformed you?** He tells of monsters attacking his house, stealing his baby from their mothers arms, and the \u201c[a wolverine, aberrant man, a ravenfolk, and a bard](/doc/the-ladys-price-9GqAM1W0Pw) named Aeff Agunwee \\[@[Stephanie Thompson](mention://f3d54782-ef14-40ec-b113-7658a2d58ceb/user/ede3d96e-f153-4485-9856-8adc04682abe)\\]!\u201d\n\n# Back to Reality\n\nThe party is wrenched back to reality, and finds themselves still at the bar surrounded by revelers. Several Iron Rider soldiers walk over and pat the Commodore on the back \u201cYou bastard! I didn\u2019t know it was your birthday!! Shots for everyone!!\u201d\n\nThe Commodore looks around, looks confused. \u201cIt\u2019s not my bi-\u201d he tries to say before someone puts a shot in his hand.\n\n## *\u201dCHEERS TO THE COMMODORE!\u201d*",

You walk past elegant houses with their darkly shingled spires piercing into the night sky behind tall hedges and iron gates, candles gleaming in the windows.*\\n\\n*As you round the corner towards your destination, you smell it before you see it. The air hangs heavy with the acrid scent of a smoldering fire. Around the perimeter, [Bloodless Sentinels](/doc/bloodless-sentinels-UAT4Khzzp1) - those dark constructs made of stone and glowing with arcane runes - move eerily quietly as they douse stubborn embers and clear debris with silent precision.* \\n\\n*You approach the scorched stone walls of [House Talindra](/doc/house-talindra-FszzcwqRUO), glittering glass crunching under foot as you find the unmistakable gate - a cat\u2019s silhouette against a full moon - cast in iron, the symbol standing tall over this once great house, now a smoldering ruin.*\n>\n> \\n ![Velryn](/api/attachments.redirect?id=a78234b3-c4d3-4412-955d-ce85e69b0636 \"right-50 =262x262\")*Standing in the gate, at the center of all this destruction, is a bald and hunched figured, leaning heavily on a cane made of ivory. His simple dark robe is adorned only with the seal of his station: a black [eye](/doc/eye-of-duskmire-zVMHbvUlGR). His piercing gaze flickers with cold calculation as he turns to greet you, tapping his cane on the stone cobbles with impatience.*\\n\\n*\u201dAh finally, you have arrived. I was very much pleased with the outcome of our prior engagement.\u201d he smiles wickedly. \u201cBut apparently our quest to blot out the cult of [Sarenrae](/doc/sarenrae-W8XCSaoR45) is not finished.\u201d he gestures at the smoldering house behind him. \u201cFirst the [bombing](/doc/session-33-duskmire-blYZec6vK6) outside [my own tower](/doc/eye-of-duskmire-zVMHbvUlGR), and then almost simultaneously across town, this\u2026. there is more work to be done.\u201d*\n\n[Velryn Blackthorn](/doc/velryn-blackthorn-bgx7zYW1b0) introduces himself to Belsifer.\n\n> *\u201cYou are party to information that I have kept very close within my tower of secrets. Thanks to [your help](/doc/shadow-covenant-HYI0KN8T86), [Mother Yara](/doc/mother-yara-dawnbringer-4dR2aoAXG6) and her top lieutenants are locked away in my dungeons\u2026.\u201d You see a glint of excitement in his eye and he contemplates this.*\\n\\n*\u201dTell me friends, I am having trouble understanding something. How is it so that a decapitated snake can strike twice in two different places?\u201d*\\n\\n*\u201dI am personally invested in the answer to this question, and so is our [Lady Nightshade](/doc/lady-nightshade-3kjLNj2Zbs). Something that rightfully belongs to her was taken by these terrorists. Assassinations and other such intrigue are common amongst the wardens, but when it spills out into public - and kills humans - well, that threatens the order of things...\u201d*\\n\\n*\u201dI suspect things are not so simple as they seem. Trust no one\u2026\u201d*\n\n# The House\n\nOur party begins their investigation here in the smoldering ruins of [House Talindra](/doc/house-talindra-FszzcwqRUO), house half standing. They enter the courtyard and begin by checking in at the stables, finding the stablemaster Harken. The party claims they are with the insurance company, and Harken reluctantly answers their questions. When asked what happened, he says \u201cThe dogs were going crazy, I thought Master [Jorek](/doc/jorek-talindra-zwTvrSOGgc) had let them out when he came in. But when I yelled for them to come back, they came in covered in blood\u2026 then I saw the bodies\u2026\u201d\n\nThe party passes through a dormitory soaked in human blood, the bodies already removed by the Sentinels. Passing through the ruins into the main hall they find evidence of a large fight. Furniture thrown against the walls and blood splatter everywhere. They pick amongst the wreckage and Belsifer finds a shiny symbol of the dove - the sign of Sarenrae - and a spell component pouch. They open it and examine the contents - an owl feather and several other things typical of a spellcaster but also a wax sealed letter\u2026\n\nThaddeus in his excitement opens it without examining it carefully, triggering a [glyph of warding](/doc/glyph-of-warding-QlcSBRrKoQ), throwing the party to the ground with the explosion and destroying whatever secret the letter held.\n\nRecovering themselves, they creep up the stairs and find more evidence of a bloody fight. Several cultists bodies lie here, along with the body of what appears to be Jorek Talindra himself, dead with his back to a wall and a knife in his side.\n\nThey search the adjacent rooms, finding an empty child\u2019s bedroom, an untouched ballroom (where Zhilwad steals a glass buck\u2019s head from above the mantle), and a bedroom cleared of everything except a large magic rune carved into the floor. Zhilwad detects conjuration and a whiff of ozone in the air and Thaddeus takes notes on it.\n\nThey finally find a locked door leading into what appears to be Talia\u2019s office. Searching the desk, they find documents related to shipments and in Talia\u2019s personal calendar the day of the attack appears to be entirely blocked out for an *\u201cIMPORTANT DELIVERY\u201d* but the party doesn\u2019t see anything in the shipment books. Behind the desk is a large oil painting of the family of the house, including a younger version of the dead Jorek sitting outside. Zhilwad examines behind it, and finds a safe!\n\nThe lock on it being a familiar matter for these adventurers, they crack it easily and inside find a strange looking bottle containing a roiling mist inside. Zhilwad takes it.\n\nBack outside, the question Harken the stablemaster again. He laments that he packed three horse\u2019s for \u201cJorek\u2019s hunting trip in the woods\u201d but that he will no longer need them. The party attempts to use their insurance ruse to \u201cborrow\u201d the horses but Harken does not oblige, welcoming them to take stock of whatever they need in the stable.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=7ab6b55d-584b-4b19-964c-29d7b3eea91e)\n\nThey find 3 skeletal horses standing listlessly in their stalls, several packs neatly assembled for 3 people. They search the packs and they find, hastily stuffed into the tops, 3 black cloaks bearing the symbol of Sarenrae. In the pocket of one they find a note in pencil *\u201dWHAT FADES BUT NEVER DIES?\u201d*\n\nTaking this clue back upstairs to the portal, and answer the riddle \u201cThe past\u201d one by one, they are whisked away into darkness.\n\n# Cultist\u2019s Hideout\n\nThe party opens their eyes into total darkness, in a large cavern of stone. They light a torch and look around, they are standing on a central altar with the same sigil as the one in the house. Surrounding the altar are rows of abandoned shoes, small bags and elvish personal items, seemingly abandoned in place long ago and covered in a thick layer of dust. The party picks their way through, following a well worn path they can see in their torchlight, leading towards a large door covered in elvish symbols. They open the door and light and wind floods out\u2026\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3hL79HU0dU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3hL79HU0dU)\n\nThey enter into another impossibly large chamber, this one with a huge crackling ball of magic energy floating in the center of the room, orbited by colorful balls of light like some great sun. Belsifer recognizes this as Selunish magic, although unstable. Lightning lashes out into the room, which has ruins which plants grow out of striving towards the light. Many statues dot this place, made of stone.\n\nThey attempt to make a run for it, but several of the party are struck by the lightning and transformed into statues themselves. Zhilwad opens up the bottle, releasing a genie named [\u00dcse](/doc/use-vREklVN71V) who comes boiling out of the bottle in the cloud. They ask for his help and he obliges, if only they will help him find a material form. He flies into the ball of energy and the party has enough time to make it across this lightning blasted landscape, towards another large door\u2026\n\n# The Ceremony\n\nThe party finds another large chamber with an altar in the center, the cultists are frantically praying before. On the altar, exuding a menacing light, is [a smooth black stone](/doc/stone-of-sargoth-the-eternal-1sQ7dwJoJz).\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=7820f460-617a-4a1d-b181-497497ab8ff0)The cultists cry out, \u201cIt\u2019s too late!!\u201d but the party quickly cuts them down, closing in on the altar before the cultists can amount much of a counter attack. \u00dcse swoops in and takes over the body of one of the fallen cultists, \u201cBwahahaha, after centuries I am free to walk amongst mortals at last\" and makes a run for the exit.\n\nAs the last cultist is about to fall to the party\u2019s weapons, instead he takes out his ceremonial dagger and approaches the altar, stabbing himself in the heart \u201cin the name of Sarenrae!\u201d and gushes blood onto the stone.\n\nHe falls down dead, but a blinding column of light erupts and ruptures through the ceiling of this place. Smoke pours from the stone and out emerges a great tentacled beast with three eyes.\n\n> The room chills as the air grows heavy. Dark energy crackles through the pillar of light, like oil dancing across the surface of water. As the radiant light of the chamber flickers wildly, shadows gather and coalesce around the **Stone** and a monstrous form begins to emerge. The shadowy avatar towers over the room, a ghastly blend of undulating, translucent flesh and long, webbed appendages. Its head is grotesque, with three lidless, glowing crimson eyes that fixate on you with an otherworldly intensity. Jagged, needle-like fangs glisten within a maw that drips with spectral ichor.\\n\\nIts voice is not spoken, but pressed into your minds, a deep and oily rasp that slithers into your thoughts:\\n\\n\u201d*Fools... you meddle with powers beyond your reckoning. I am **[Sargoth](/doc/sargoth-the-eternal-9tzjV8CP1Q)**, progenitor of the hunger - neither the sun nor the moon can consume my darkness for I am the first, the last, the eternal.* \\n\\n*You dare to draw me here? Into your petty ambitions? I have felt the Lady Nightshade\u2019s call, but I did not think she would send those so unworthy\u2026.*\\n\\n*I will consume your dreams, your world, your memory - you will be nothing, the cycle will be broken, the void will become all again.\u201d*\n\nThe party fights a desperate battle against this beast, getting in many critical hits and attempting to dodge it\u2019s tentacle attacks and commanding eyes. The beast blows off the attacks, focusing in on Barnabas, *\u201dMy son, we could be great together. Join me and we will destroy all of wretched humanity once and for all.*\u201d\n\nBarnabas is drawn in my the seductive calls of Sargoth. He is grappled by the tentacles, unable to get away.\n\nSargoth ascends through the column of light and dissapears, taking Barnabas with him.\n\n\\\n",

As a youth, his interests skewed towards more scholastic pursuits and spent countless hours at the library, however his naturally physical gifts of size and strength affected how his peers viewed him.\n\n\\\nStanding at 6ft 4inches tall and weighing in at 275lbs, Tharac found that his intimidating size was much more of an asset than any sort of intellectual or creative endeavors or interests he may have had. Begrudgingly and reluctantly, Tharac has embraced his physical gifts.\n\n\\\nWhile volunteering with [The Silver Suns](https://lore.dungeon.church/doc/the-silver-suns-Qtggev16EG) in New Galmarden, he witnesses a a rogue by the name of [Pantelleon Thorngage](/doc/panteleon-thorngage-9YcdfHf4au), whose malfeasance causes a fire during an attempted theft. With the local villagers ready to get some mob justice, Tharac recognized the gnome\u2019s dazed and confused look as a symptom of a baddd mushroom trip, so he stepped in and saved the rogue from the angry mob.

Her mother Teneb held her forward as Domuz Shurak painted ritual markings on her face and chest. One by one, elders offered their blessings, their words blending with the din of insects and frogsong.\n\nOn her turn, seer Magali recalled to everyone's mind the salient events of the day: a distant elder silverback and a jaguar cub roared simultaneously; a dry wind blew across the northern swamp; young Jacroom returned home with six spotted blue slugs (a bountiful haul for a novice).\n\n\"Change will follow this child like fire follows lightning. She will bring abundance, and strife. New ways will arrive from the outside world. And like me, this one has the eye. She will gaze at distant seasons as elders recall memories of the past.\"\n\n\\---\n\nLike all children of the Vohata, Jutra spent her days playing games, learning crafts, exploring the wilderness, chasing animals. She learned to identify flora and fauna with all her senses. With the hunters she learned nuances of tracks and leavings, to fletch arrows, to trap game. Unlike the other children however, Jutra was recognized to have the spark of magic. Such a gift was not to be left unnurtured; Jutra practiced ritual magics daily under the tutelage of Magali.\n\nOnce a year each spring, Magali would take Jutra on a trek into human lands. They visited folk magicians, alchemists, and tinkerers. Magali's purpose was multiple; to mix minds with fellow arcane practitioners, to update her stock of foreign ingredients, and to gain a sense of the direction the winds were blowing in human affairs. \n\nDuring their encounters, Jutra was always rapt, weather watching paltry parlor tricks or impressive displays of flame. Magali quietly reveled at Jutra's expressions of wonder and excitement. She lamented that they would not visit the Academy at Striborg. \"Why shouldn't we go there, Sha?\", asked Jutra. \"Someday, fawn. You will go there yourself.\"\n\nAs Jutra entered her teenage years, old age started making travel difficult for Magali. They began visiting Daurag'Obra, a trading post on the border of Tribe territory. Daurag'Obra presented to the Tribes easy access to human metalcrafts, tools, fabrics, but also exposed them to human entertainment and vices.\n\nAt fifteen, Jutra started visiting Daurag'Obra alone. Initially, she sought to fill the niche market for animal parts to be sold in city apothecaries. But soon the draw of the dynamic social scene was all she thought about. Magali cautioned against the habits of humans; the tribeborn at Daurag'Obra had lost their way. With hormones hitting hard, Jutra rebelled not only against the wisdom of Magali, but that of her own visions. She flouted consequence and indulged in pleasures with wild and impulsive men. Three years later she was caring for two children and a drunk boyfriend.\n\nJutra returned to the Vohata. She had forgotten how vibrant and invigorating life was back home, the closeness she felt to the primal spirits. Her sons Kajor and Faizel, at first fish out of water, began to thrive in their new environment. Jutra began to take on responsibilities Magali once held. She eventually cultivated a healthy partnership with Wa'Torog, an older hunter. Wa'Torog, who never had children of his own, enjoyed taking the boys on hunting trips and imparting his knowledge of the jungle. Their daughter Ushembi was born a year later. Life was good... \n\nBut change is never far from Jutra. Pregnant with her fourth child, she once again felt restless. Reminiscing of her her treks with Magali, she knew what she had to do.\n\n\\---\n\n\"So piglets. Who remembers what landmarks we'll see as we come up on our destination?\"\n\n\"What's a destination?\", asked Faizel.\n\n\"Come now, you know that word. It's where we're going.\"\n\n\"Striborg?\"\n\n\"Yes... that's the big city. But first we're going to a smaller town...do you boys remember what it's called?\"\n\n\"Wait I see it! The gnarled tree--that has a face! Is that it?\"\n\n\"Well that tree looks good and gnarly dunnit. Kinda looks like two eyes there, and a mouth? Then what?\"\n\n\"Buttholes!\"\n\n\"Exactly right Kajor, buttholes. What's after the buttholes?\"\n\n\"The road will go up and then there will be a rock and...\"\n\nAt that moment both boys saw a fifteen foot limestone slab peeking over the horizon of the road. Instantly the boys began sprinting to the lookout, overcome with the urge to conquer the summit. Jutra smiled, adjusted Ushembi's position, and followed at her snail's pace, anticipating the forthcoming exclamation.\n\n\"Mama I see it! Saltmarsh!\"\n\n\\\n\\\n[DnD_5E_Jutra.pdf 675989](/api/attachments.redirect?id=49c74c9e-cff8-41f8-bd42-a463b7079f22)\n\n\\\n",

While slow moving and unintelligent, when provoked they respond with drunken rage.\n\n***Ooze Nature.*** A vomit ooze doesn't require sleep, air, or food but consuming more alcohol makes it grow larger in size and more chaotic in temperament.

Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the deep crow can't use its mandibles on another target.\n\n***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.\n\n## Deep Crow\n\nThe only warning you'll get is that fearsome, far-off caw, echoing from the darkness like a death knell. For by the time those glowing red eyes fix on you, it's far too late to run...\n\nSome adventurers and sages whisper that deep crows were first spawned as the familiars of evil arcane casters, abandoned in the subterranean depths and left to grow to enormous size. Others claim these creatures were once normal crows transmuted by vile essence and viler powers. But one thing all agree on is that ending up a meal for one of these monstrosities is a too-real threat for those who stumble into their deadly lairs.\n\nThough the deep crow most immediately resembles a massive version of its namesake bird, this creature is a unique form of avian insect. Seen up close, it can easily be discerned from any other giant bird by its insectoid maw, its four-clawed feet, and the cluster of red eyes that are the most unsettling part of its appearance.\n\n***Terror from Above.*** The deep crow's most fearsome attack is the bite of its mandibles, which can seize and hold almost any creature. Their preferred attack is a snatch-and-grab that sees a deep crow flying off with a living victim before its companions have any chance of counterattack. Provided the doomed prey doesn't struggle, the deep crow takes it back to its lair to be devoured at leisure. Creatures that do struggle might be repeatedly dropped from a height to soften them up a bit.\n\n***Family Ties.*** Deep crows live alone for an unknown length of years, emerging from the lair only to hunt, to look for potential threats, and to mate. Mating is a once-in-a-lifetime urge that sees each deep crow involved in the pairing produce a cluster of four to eight eggs. Incubation lasts a year, followed by a year during which the fledgling deep crows stay close by their parent's side. The young then set out to establish lairs of their own.\n\n***Unknown and Inscrutable.*** The mindset of these intelligent yet alien creatures is a mystery, but some who have encountered them relate that they are quick to hold a grudge. For years. Of even greater importance, they can teach their chicks to harbor the same resentments, instilling a cross-generational hatred of chosen foes that can last for centuries.\n\n***A Deep Crow's Lair.*** Deep crows and ancient deep crows roost in places both deep and warm, favoring sites with access to exposed lava. The spires of volcanic rock the creatures prize as roosts are common in such places, whose ambient warmth provides constant temperature regulation for the creature's eggs.",

Around you, the twisted trees of the [Dreadwood](/doc/dreadwood-GcfKdBzGyT) loom, their skeletal branches grasping towards a sun that does not shine here.* \\n\\n*After a while through the trees, a wide, polished obsidian road emerges from the mist, leading up to a towering black gate. The gate is a fortress in itself\u2014heavily fortified, its iron portcullis lowered, while a long line of weary souls passes through guarded checkpoints, their faces gaunt and hollow.*\n>\n> \\n*Around outskirts of the high obsidian walls, piles of decaying bodies are stacked high, discarded like refuse, the carrion of a city that feeds on death. The stench of rot clings to the air, and the silhouettes of vultures circle lazily above. Bloated ghouls, their decayed forms swollen with gas, drift lazily atop the river\u2019s surface like gruesome landmines. Great iron grates, three stories tall, rise from the fetid waters, where the river passes through, its flow sluggish and dark.* \n\nThe party debates what to do, and the ferryman says only \u201cthose with invitations\u201d can pass through the gates\u2026 but may not be able to pass back out. The party tells him to row them to the great river gates so they can investigate, but he gets agitated and refuses, \u201cToo dangerous, I won\u2019t go back!\u201d. Anderdingus strikes him, and he falls to the deck, chained to his cursed station. The boat lurches through the fog, closer to the [bloated ghouls](/doc/bloated-ghouls-Ufcfzel5Di) who gnash their teeth and attempt to propel their inflated bodies towards the boat. One gets close to the rear of the boat, and latches on to its wooden side with its teeth.\n\nRado and Ramoth create illusions - fog to cover them and the sound of someone thrashing in the water. This draws some of the ghouls away, but the boat continues to lurch through the current and soon the party finds themself with no choice but to fight the terrible things off.\n\nUnfortunately, puncturing them with their weapons unleashes a terrible poison gas which sickens them. Bahruhn lights the boat on fire and Ama makes a swim for the iron river gate, making it to land only to find several [zombie vultures](/doc/zombie-vulture-Uc0z6ODNRp) have been attracted by the scent of rot.\n\nThe ferryman, unaffected by the poison, cackles as the boat rises in flames and the party takes some nasty blows from the now very agitated ghouls. The vultures peck at them, unleashing more poison gas. But as the boat goes down they manage to escape and reassemble their wet selves on a narrow maintenance ledge, trapped outside the portcullis staring at the city beyond.\n\nAma steadies herself and embraces the part of her that is now undead and passes through the iron to the other side as a specter, letting the others in behind her.\n\n# The Streets of Duskmire\n\n ![Duskmire river rafts](/api/attachments.redirect?id=00a88610-a9ab-4a05-8658-a86d139d4913 \"right-50 =244x144\")The party takes in the city before them - the black tower of [The Eye](/doc/eye-of-duskmire-zVMHbvUlGR) and the distant [Crimson Court](/doc/crimson-court-cofX8ha90z) & dark castle on a distant hill. A perpetual gloom hangs over the city and tendrils of fog from the Dreadwood roll menacingly over the black gates. Rafts of inflated pigskins float down the Saltmarsh river carrying goods and dark hooded citizens with their heads down go about their business.\n\nAcross the river, Ramoth immediately recognizes that the small island is full of very fine, very large mansions that are in a fey style of architecture. The party walks to the bridge, but finds it heavily guarded by constructs made of polished obsidian, their surface glowing with pulsing runes. They watch as a dwarf pushes a small cart with what appear to be deliveries, stopping to show the constructs his papers \u201cTHANK YOU CITIZEN, PROCEED\u201d. Rado attempts to send his familiar over to watch where the dwarf goes, but the distance is too great to follow as the dwarf rounds a corner. Rado does see that the streets on that side of the river are heavily patrolled by the same [obsidian sentinels](/doc/bloodless-sentinels-UAT4Khzzp1).\n\nFinding themselves in a merchant district, they walk a ways and see if they can find a potion shop\u2026.\n\n## [Grim Mold\u2019s Relics](/doc/grim-molds-relics-Q0YvmvmjLp)\n\n>  ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=e4c5bb20-dd95-4a43-9096-88934ee73232 \"right-50 =262x262\")*[Grim Mold](/doc/grim-mold-US6JMu5NLP) is an enormous, hunched creature with a grotesque appearance that contrasts sharply with his refined manners. His skin is a mottled mix of dark greens and grays, covered in warts and scars from past battles. His tusks protrude slightly from his wide mouth, but his voice is warm and soothing. Dressed in an ill-fitting but ornate jacket with a sapphire [nightshade flower](/doc/sapphire-nightshade-Qvbjiqksvy) pinned to it.*\n\nAs the party enters they are greeted by an enormous and hideous (but very polite) troll who introduces himself as Mr. Grim Mold, purveyor of exquisite relics. They ask if he has a cure for poison.\n\n\"Why,\" he might say, \"a little misfortune is the spice of life! Think of the tales you\u2019ll tell once you\u2019ve overcome the curse! People do so love a good story, don't they?\"\n\nHe rummages around in the cabinet of curiosities behind him and presents Ramoth with a bottle of [Whisperwine](/doc/whisperwine-PWBtjr4LcS) \u201ca very nice vintage\u201d. When it becomes clear that Mr. Mold only sells cursed items, Bahruhn attempts to bargain with him and presents the [Amulet of Betrayal](/doc/amulet-of-betrayal-vY1rCwAwHh).\n\nThey ask where he got his Sapphire Nightshade flower, and he tells them he goes for a walk by the docks every morning and buys one from the stevedores.\n\nMr. Mold pulls out a jeweler\u2019s loupe and gets very quiet. \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d he asks. Turning it over in his hands he points to the inscription *L. S.* \"This belonged to the Lady\u2019s [Knight](/doc/lamont-solmar-GLrWBoIX5h)? Surely if he blessed you with it, I cannot accept it.\u201d Mr Mold politely, but firmly, says, \u201cI think you should be going now\u2026\u201d eyeing the party with a renewed interest\u2026\n\n## Cultists\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=766163ac-fc03-428e-bfee-aa15c4f86ee4)\n\nAs the players cut through a dark alley back towards the river, they come across a small gathering of people listening to a ragged, disheveled man standing on a crate at the corner of an alley. His eyes are wide, shining with both madness and conviction, and his voice echoes down the street in a frenzied cadence. His clothes are torn and filthy, his hair wild and unkempt, but there\u2019s an eerie intensity to his words that draws people in. He waves his arms with every word.\n\n> *\"The time is near!\"* the prophet raves, his voice rising with each syllable. *\"The dawn will rise, brighter than the blackest night, and with it will come the cleansing fire!\"* His eyes gleam with madness as he gestures wildly to the sky. *\"[The mother](/doc/mother-yara-dawnbringer-4dR2aoAXG6) walks among us, unseen, ready to stamp out the darkness!* \n\nThe party looks at the assembled crowd and sees average human citizens in their dark cloaks, hoods all clasped with pins bearing various symbols and heraldry. They listen to the preacher, and Bahruhn realizes he speaks of [Sarenrae](/doc/sarenrae-W8XCSaoR45)\u2026. the man is wearing a dove.\n\nAs the gathering breaks up, Bahruhn approaches the street preacher \u201cBrother, who is the mother?\u201d the man eyes him up and sees Bahruhn\u2019s dove as well. \u201c[Mother Yara - the Dawnbringer](/doc/mother-yara-dawnbringer-4dR2aoAXG6)! Her time is near!\u201d\n\nAma plays her lute and the party manages to steal a few of the brooches all the other humans appear to be wearing - these bear the symbols of 2 fish and a cat.\n\n## The Garden\n\nThe party continues walking, in the direction of the large black tower, and comes to a very pleasant park with apple trees filled with beautiful fruit. They feel suspicious, but see two young, healthy looking children filling a basket with the fruits. One of the kids throws an apple at Bahruhn, but he deflects it. Anderdingus is hit in the face.\n\nAma does some people watching, and notices one of the obsidian constructs walking through the crowd, the humans giving it a wide berth\u2026. except for 3 men who appear to be following it\u2026 and they look to be wearing dove brooches\u2026 she sees one reach into his cloak\u2026.\n\n# The Bombing\n\n> *Windows rattle as the roar of an explosion fills the street. Charred bodies and anguished screams fly through the air. A thick cloud of acrid smoke billows outward from the blast, and debris and shrapnel goes flying towards you.*\\n\\n*When the smoke dissipates you see several bodies (.. and grimly, body parts) strewn about the street. Through the haze a man in a dark jacket stumbles toward one of the downed figures, taking something and running off into the chaos.*\n>\n> \\n*People spew from the doors of nearby buildings, running to those who lie prone. You smell burning flesh and soot seems to cover everything including yourselves in a fine film.*\n\nThe party attempts to dodge the shrapnel and debris, and falls to the ground prone. Ama sees the sentinel go down, and the man run. She yells out to the others, and Bahruhn dashes after him.\n\nAs people begin to come out of the buildings, helping the fallen, the party looks around and sees the sentinel is\u2026.. gone? The body at the epicenter of the explosion appears to be a dhampir man, taking his last dying breaths\u2026 \u201cThey\u2026 stole\u2026 it\u2026\u201d He wears a brooch with the symbol of a black eye.\n\nBahruhn chases after the man and his two conspirators as they all make their way north, heading for the maze of dark alleys in the tenements that make up the northernmost neighborhood of this end of Duskmire. The man laughs and throws ball bearings at his pursuers, filling the alley. Bahruhn leaps but can\u2019t quite clear it\u2026 he slips.\n\nThe party dusts themselves off and regroups - some kind of Sarenrae terrorism? A dhampir disguised as a construct? \n\nSirens begin to wail in the distance.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=a740d9a1-441c-4f43-953e-ecda1736d67d)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAnoryONNWI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAnoryONNWI)\n\n\\\n",

On a success, a target takes half the damage and isn't stunned.\n\n***Ink Cloud (Recharge 6).*** A 20-foot-radius cloud of darkness extends around the gargoctopus. The area is heavily obscured until the start of the gargoctopus' next turn. If underwater, the gargoctopus can use the Dash action as a bonus action after releasing the cloud.\n\n\n---\n\n\\\n\\\n",

A creature that touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is diseased for 1d4 hours. The diseased creature can breathe only underwater.\n\n***Probing Telepathy.*** If a creature communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the aboleth learns the creature's greatest desires if the aboleth can see the creature.\n\n### Actions\n\n***Multiattack.*** The aboleth makes three tentacle attacks.\n\n***Tentacle.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The disease has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed by any magic that cures disease. After 1 minute, the diseased creature's skin becomes translucent and slimy, the creature can't regain hit points unless it is underwater, and the disease can be removed only by *heal* or another disease-curing spell of 6th level or higher. When the creature is outside a body of water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to the skin before 10 minutes have passed.\n\n***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.\n\n***Enslave (3/Day).*** The aboleth targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from the target. The charmed target is under the aboleth's control and can't take reactions, and the aboleth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance.Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from the aboleth.\n\n### Legendary Actions\n\nThe aboleth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The aboleth regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.\n\n* **Detect.** The aboleth makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.\n* **Tail Swipe.** The aboleth makes one tail attack.\n* **Psychic Drain (Costs 2 Actions).** One creature charmed by the aboleth takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and the aboleth regains hit points equal to the damage the creature takes.\n\n## Aboleth\n\nBefore the coming of the gods, aboleths lurked in primordial oceans and underground lakes. They reached out with their minds and seized control of the burgeoning life-forms of the mortal realm, making those creatures their slaves. Their dominance made them like gods. Then the true gods appeared, smashing the aboleths' empire and freeing their slaves. Aboleths have never forgotten.\n\n***Eternal Memories.*** Aboleths have flawless memories. They pass on their knowledge and experience from generation to generation. Thus, the injury of their defeat by the gods remains perfectly preserved in their minds.\n\nAboleths' minds are treasure troves of ancient lore, recalling moments from prehistory with perfect clarity. They plot patiently and intricately across eons. Few creatures can conceive of the extent of an aboleth's plan.\n\n***Gods in the Lake.*** Aboleths dwell in watery environments, including ocean abysses, deep lakes, and the Elemental Plane of Water. In these domains and the lands that adjoin them, aboleths are like gods, demanding worship and obedience from their subjects. When they consume other creatures, aboleths add the knowledge and experiences of their prey to their eternal memories. Aboleths use their telepathic powers to read the minds of creatures and know their desires. An aboleth uses this knowledge to gain a creature's loyalty, promising to fulfill such wants in exchange for obedience. Within its lair, the aboleth can further use its powers to override senses, granting creatures, such as its followers, the illusion of promised rewards.\n\n***Enemies of the Gods.*** The aboleths' fall from power is written in stark clarity on their flawless memories, for aboleths never truly die. If an aboleth's body is destroyed, its spirit returns to the Elemental Plane of Water, where a new body coalesces for it over days or months.\n\nUltimately, aboleths dream of overthrowing the gods and regaining control of the world. Aboleths have had untold eons to plot and to prepare their plans for perfect execution.\n\n> *Could it be that the aboleths are older than the gods... that before the divine ones came to be, such horrors shaped the multiverse? Now there's a chilling thought.*\u2014 Vaqir Zekh'r, githzerai philosopher and author of The Far Realm: Real Yet Unreal\n\n### An Aboleth's Lair\n\nAboleths lair in subterranean lakes or the rocky depths of the ocean, often surrounded by the ruins of an ancient, fallen aboleth city. An aboleth spends most of its existence underwater, surfacing occasionally to treat with visitors or deranged worshipers.\n\n#### Lair Actions\n\nWhen fighting inside its lair, an aboleth can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the aboleth takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:\n\n* The aboleth casts *phantasmal force* (no components required) on any number of creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. While maintaining concentration on this effect, the aboleth can't take other lair actions. If a target succeeds on the saving throw or if the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the aboleth's phantasmal force lair action for the next 24 hours, although such a creature can choose to be affected.\n* Pools of water within 90 feet of the aboleth surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone. The aboleth can't use this lair action again until it has used a different one.\n* Water in the aboleth's lair magically becomes a conduit for the creature's rage. The aboleth can target any number of creatures it can see in such water within 90 feet of it. A target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or take 7 (2d6) psychic damage. The aboleth can't use this lair action again until it has used a different one.\n\n#### Regional Effects\n\nThe region containing an aboleth's lair is warped by the creature's presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n* Underground surfaces within 1 mile of the aboleth's lair are slimy and wet and are difficult terrain.\n* Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the aboleth that drink such water vomit it within minutes.\n* As an action, the aboleth can create an illusory image of itself within 1 mile of the lair. The copy can appear at any location the aboleth has seen before or in any location a creature charmed by the aboleth can currently see. Once created, the image lasts for as long as the aboleth maintains concentration, as if concentrating on a spell. Although the image is intangible, it looks, sounds, and can move like the aboleth. The aboleth can sense, speak, and use telepathy from the image's position as if present at that position. If the image takes any damage, it disappears.\n\nIf the aboleth dies, the first two effects fade over the course of 3d10 days.",

      "content": "\\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=c0d19b9a-ee97-4b5c-be7f-f1af52345ffc)**Name**: Hydrax Riverscales\\n**Race**: Blue Dragonborn\\n**Class**: Barbarian\\n**Background**:\n\nHydrax was born in a small, secluded dragonborn village called [Fallowhold](/doc/fallowhold-uW0oE42B6F), nestled deep within the mountains. From a young age, he was different from his peers. While others focused on honing their physical strength, Hydrax was more interested in the wisdom of the elders and the ancient stories they told. His keen mind and sharp wit often got him out of trouble, even when his muscles couldn\u2019t.\n\n**Personality Traits**:\n\nHydrax is a charming and warm-hearted man who cares deeply about nature and the people around him, though he's hesitant to reveal this aspect of himself, often masking it with witty and flirtatious comments. His outward social confidence masks his private insecurities about his appearance and lifestyle. Beneath his tough exterior lies a heart of gold and a reservoir of wisdom, which he generously imparts to those who seek it. He frequently turns to drinking as a way to escape the sorrows of his past and the dissonance of not living his true life.\n\n **Character Details**:\n\n**Height, Age, and Build:** Hydrax stands at a modest 5'11\" with a fat and sturdy build. He is also a robust adult at the age of 168 years.\n\n**Scales and Color:** His scales boast a deep, shimmering blue, accented with lighter blue patterns reminiscent of flowing water.\n\n**Clothing and Armor**: He wears a large open shirt that can be mistaken for a short cape, frayed pants, and fingerless gloves. Hydrax hates shoes and armor and never takes off his sapphire pendant.\n\n**Eyes**: Hydrax's eyes are a striking silver.\n\n**Distinctive Quirks**: Hydrax often drags his tail when annoyed or upset and picks at his scales when uncomfortable.\n\n**General Demeanor**: Despite his formidable presence, Hydrax exudes a quiet confidence and a gentle nature. He is often lost in thought, with a contemplative expression, and tends to slouch in familiar company.\n\n**Sexual Orientation**: Hydrax is openly bisexual, flirting with both men and women indiscriminately. His charisma and humor make him a popular person in social circles.\n\n**Important Events**:\n\n\n1. **The Sapphire Pendant**: The sapphire pendant he carries was a gift from his first love, a dwarf bard named Rylan from a neighboring village. They shared a brief, yet passionate 20-year romance before Rylan was tragically killed, having accidentally become entangled in a bandit raid while on his way to visit. Hydrax cherishes the pendant given to him by Rylan as a memento of their love and a symbol of hope that he may find such love again. Rylan possessed a matching ruby pendant from Hydrax, which was stolen during the raid. Hydrax is determined to reclaim it someday. \n2. **The Wanderer\u2019s Path**: After Rylan\u2019s death, Hydrax left his village and became a wanderer. He traveled from town to town, seeking solace in the bottom of a tankard and the warmth of fleeting romances. His travels have made him wise beyond his years, but they have also left him feeling isolated and unworthy of lasting love.\n3. **Training as a Fighter**: From a young age, Hydrax was trained to be a fighter, following his village's tradition. However, he never excelled in combat due to his passionate nature and desire to learn about the world beyond his village. He devoted his free time to absorbing knowledge from the village elders and venturing into the outskirts of his home. Although he took on the role of a warrior to honor his village, it left him conflicted between his obligations and his true calling.\n\n**Goals and Motivations**:\n\nHydrax\u2019s primary goal is to find true love, but he struggles with feelings of inadequacy due to his lifestyle and appearance. He believes that his rough, nomadic life and his dragonborn heritage make him unlovable. However, deep down, he yearns for someone who can see past his exterior and love him for who he truly is. (Secret motivation from me is for him to find a life path that better suits his personality).\n\n**Current Quest**:\n\nHydrax has recently heard rumors of a legendary artifact known as the [Heart of the Dragon](/doc/heart-of-the-dragon-0j0ecpaXmU), said to grant its bearer the power to see their true self and find their heart\u2019s desire. Believing this might be the key to finding love and acceptance, Hydrax has set out on a quest to find the artifact, hoping it will help him overcome his insecurities and find the love he longs for.\n\n\\\nHyrax Riverscales character sheet:\n\n\\\n[Hydrax character sheet.pdf 623264](/api/attachments.redirect?id=5f1de046-f75c-42bc-a0f2-6ec9770741f7)\n\n\\\n",

The myconid dies if it spends more than 1 hour in direct sunlight.\n\n### Actions\n\n***Multiattack.*** The myconid uses either its Hallucination Spores or its Pacifying Spores, then makes a fist attack.\n\n***Fist.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (3d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (3d4) poison damage.\n\n***Animating Spores (3/Day).*** The myconid targets one corpse of a humanoid or a Large or smaller beast within 5 feet of it and releases spores at the corpse. In 24 hours, the corpse rises as a spore servant. The corpse stays animated for 1d4 + 1 weeks or until destroyed, and it can't be animated again in this way.\n\n***Hallucination Spores.*** The myconid ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target is incapacitated while it hallucinates. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n***Pacifying Spores.*** The myconid ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n***Rapport Spores.*** A 30-foot radius of spores extends from the myconid. These spores can go around corners and affect only creatures with an Intelligence of 2 or higher that aren't undead, constructs, or elementals. Affected creatures can communicate telepathically with one another while they are within 30 feet of each other. The effect lasts for 1 hour.\n\n## Myconid Sovereign\n\nMyconids are intelligent, ambulatory fungi that live in the Underdark, seek enlightenment, and deplore violence. If approached peacefully, myconids gladly provide shelter or allow safe passage through their colonies.\n\n***Circles and Melds.*** The largest myconid in a colony is its sovereign, which presides over one or more social groups called circles. A circle consists of twenty or more myconids that work, live, and meld together.\n\nA meld is a form of communal meditation that allows myconids to transcend their dull subterranean existence. The myconids' rapport spores bind the participants into a group consciousness. Hallucination spores then induce a shared dream that provides entertainment and social interaction. Myconids consider melding to be the purpose of their existence. They use it in the pursuit of higher consciousness, collective union, and spiritual apotheosis. Myconids also use their rapport spores to communicate telepathically with other sentient creatures.\n\n***Myconid Reproduction.*** Like other fungi, myconids reproduce by mundane sporing. They carefully control their spores' release to avoid overpopulation.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Source: [Monster Manual](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#myconid%20sovereign_mm)\n\n[https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#myconid%20sovereign%5Fmm](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#myconid%20sovereign%5Fmm)\n\n\\\n",

Only Ama is able to escape the slippery tide of gore, but she is cornered by a blood drenched spirit that appears in the form of [Eldan Fletcher](/doc/eldan-fletcher-QWyA10eG7I).\n\nThe great worm\u2019s eye begins to glow, and it makes eye contact with those nearby. They see a vision of the world from above, splitting into pieces, unleashing dragon fire and an ocean full of great serpents eating their own tails. They feel their insignificance before this seemingly immortal beast.\n\nThey attempt to get the upper hand by casting [Darkness](/doc/darkness-tYDAHpXMtw) on a torch and throwing it towards the creature. Ama casts [Shatter](/doc/shatter-yjdXR6DPdg) into this void and the great beast roars in pain.\n\nThe vortex of blood becomes a stronger current, and the players engulfed in it attempt to swim toward\u2019s safety and abandon the fight. They see a portal open up in the blood where the beast once stood, and it sucks down the darkness into an even blacker void. Bahruhn feels the pull of the void on his soul, calling him away from [Sarenrae](/doc/sarenrae-W8XCSaoR45)\u2019s light, but the others yell at him to swim away. Rado sends his familar across the threshold of the portal, the air crackling with energy as it crosses, and it immediately flies away in a terror.\n\nAma casts [Water Shape](/doc/shape-water-S3PPAy4i47) to make a raft of blood that the party rides to the exit of this foul room. The beating of the heart gets louder and the walls shake with the effort of it - the blood in the room rises.\n\nTheir makeshift raft and the strong current carries them through the dungeon, they run from the rising red tide up the stairs back to the attic of the house.\n\n# Amelia\n\nWhen they emerge upstairs, the blood erupts in a geyser from the hidden staircase, covering the misty landscape below in a red tint.\n\nThe house is in ruins, shattered apart. [Amelia](/doc/amelia-mAibH1T0Em) stands in the courtyard, laying [sapphire nightshade](/doc/sapphire-nightshade-Qvbjiqksvy) flowers at the altar to two now familiar looking children - [Barnaby & Sebastian](/doc/sebastian-barnaby-oweland-c5f2wjsPvu). The toy house has been thrown and broken at their feet.\n\nAmelia looks up at them, \u201cIt is time to get to the heart of the matter, will you accept [the Lady](/doc/the-ladys-price-9GqAM1W0Pw)\u2019s gift? Eternal life and boundless power? Or will you cling to your pathetic mortality until the bitter end?\u201d She looks at Bahruhn, \u201cWill you continue to worship those who will be blotted out in the Lady\u2019s shadow?\u201d\n\n> *==\u201cYou must make a choice.\u201d==*\n\nShe bends down to collect a bit of earth, mixing it with a liquid between her fingers. Everyone in the party is [turned to stone](/doc/flesh-to-stone-eIRpJOept7), statuesque and silent.\n\n### Ama, Spectre\n\nAmelia [Misty Step](/doc/misty-step-sfXv2cyt66)\u2019s to where Ama is, and places her hand on her cheek. She returns to mortal form on bended knee. She looks into Ama\u2019s eyes: \u201cIt is good to see you again, baby boy. It breaks my heart that you could not ascend to darkness before the touch of undeath put you beyond her reach\u2026..\u201d\n\nAma attempts to resist, but is overcome by the spirit of [Barnaby](/doc/sebastian-barnaby-oweland-c5f2wjsPvu). Her face for just a moment transforms into his horrifying visage.\n\nAmelia sheds a single tear.\n\n\u201cYou can still be eternal, in your own way. Embrace darkness and you can still ascend with us, become powerful beyond your wildest dreams. But the Lady has a price.\u201d\n\nThe party behind her begins to fight off their petrified status, and they yell out, but cannot stop Amelia\u2019s charm.\n\n### Greyson, Vampire\n\nAmelia walks to Greyson, placing her hand on his shoulder, he finds himself on bended knee in the flesh again.\n\n\u201cDeath has already touched you - you have killed an innocent, have you not? I have one question for you: When you took that life, did you feel remorse or did it thrill you?\u201d\n\n> ==Greyson answers: \u201c***BOTH!\u201d***==\n\n\u201cYou must embrace that darkness within you, or you will end up like your friend - [outside the gates](/doc/outer-circle-wpbygPZiuW) of the immortals.\u201d She gestures to Ama, recovering from her possession. \u201cYou can be greater than the elves of old, eternal life can still be yours, will you accept it?\u201d\n\nAmelia draws her fangs and drinks Greyson\u2019s blood. He collapses in exhaustion.\n\nAmelia turns into a red mist and disperses into the roiling fog, her skeletal steed collapses into nothing but bones and dust.\n\n# Return to Reality\n\nThe party gathers themselves, taking in what they have just experienced. The fog begins to recede and suddenly things come into a little sharper focus around them\u2026 a little more real. Soon they are just standing in the mud of the forgotten street, looking at an ordinary abandoned house. Ama looks to the attic window and sees a childlike silhouette waving at her.\n\nAma sets the house on fire and watches it burn, the clouds of black smoke driving away what little is left of the fog.\n\nGreyson and Ama both realize they are wearing the ring from their nightmare long ago - [Lady Nightshade\u2019s Ring](/doc/nightshades-ring-D07HSUmuuy).\n\n## Caelum the Druid\n\nThe party continues walking down the road, following their map to where they think the river must be that will take them to [Duskmire](/doc/duskmire-hJey19lfsu).\n\nSoon enough, they see a familiar sign with a bucket nailed to a tree: *==FINGAS PLZ==*\n\nBahruhn deposits the last of his finger stash.\n\nThe moon breaks through the canopy of the [Dreadwood](/doc/dreadwood-GcfKdBzGyT) and they see a ramshackle cabin, covered in ivy, welcoming candles burning in the windows, and the smell of smoke and soup puffing from the crooked chimney.\n\nSeveral undead or zombie animals wander aimlessly through the meadow, but they pay no mind to the party.\n\nThey knock at the door, and a strange druid with lichens in his beard and an undead bird\u2019s nest in his dirty hat. He introduces himself as Caelum and seems slightly insane, fond of his undead animals, but otherwise a welcoming host. The [zombie raccoons](/doc/zombie-raccoon-kRMzfO1jg9) run around mischievously, trying to steal from the soup pot that Caelum stirs.\n\nAma is not so sure and casts [Tiny Hut](/doc/leomunds-tiny-hut-Nbn6HCph7L) outside.\n\nThe party converses with [Caelum](/doc/caelum-SHH5bzkRpF) and sees old scars all over his arms, he claims he escaped from Duskmire \u201cvery difficult, very high walls\u201d. He now tends after the undead animals who are turned by feeding on the offal from the dark city. He feels responsible for them, cast out of the terrible vampire stronghold like himself. Eventually Caelum realizes that Greyson has been turned, and he revokes his invitation. Greyson is forced by an unseen hand outside the door and he stares in from the window like a weirdo. Ama won\u2019t let him into the hut either.\n\nThe party asks if Caelum knows any way to remove these burdens from Amelia, and he says only by \u201cforbidden soul magic\u201d. Rado recalls [Brottor](/doc/brottor-the-wizard-g7f0cZagJh) warning him against this very type of thing - a corruption of life, he called it.\n\nBahruhn gives Caelum a sample of [Nightshade Poison](/doc/nightshade-poison-rGISMbm8AA), and asks if he can come up with an antidote. Caleum says it make take some time, and he will send his one-eyed undead crow Murder to send word. The party buys some of Caelum\u2019s [weird](/doc/spores-of-delirium-JpyH7CL4vS) [potions](/doc/vial-of-the-last-harvest-tsIxDMwTeP) and beds down in the straw on the floor.\n\n## Greyson\u2019s Feeding\n\nGreyson, alone in the cold and uninvited to both shelters, feels overwhelmed by his new sanguine thirst. It overpowers his better judgement, and under the moonlight he dons his [Fedora of Disguise](/doc/fedora-of-disguise-c7i4G0ePRf) to appear as a traveler injured by wild beasts. He knocks at Caelum\u2019s door, who appears with a lantern - \u201cAnother traveler? Who goes there?\u201d\n\nGreyson deceives him, and slips in once invited to drink of Caelum\u2019s blood.\n\nAt what passes for first light in the Dreadwood, the party moves on before Caelum wakes. Raymoth casts [Plant Growth](/doc/plant-growth-xiMcnsXXYL) to gift Caelum extra fruit from his trees.\n\n## Ramoth\u2019s Dream\n\nRamoth has a vision of her patron, the Unseelie princess [Nerium](/doc/nerium-fGANF3SomK). \u201cWe can speak because the veil between the worlds is weak here\u2026. you must come to the [Crimson Court](/doc/crimson-court-cofX8ha90z), I can only hold back the Lady\u2019s ambitions for so long\u2026\u201d\n\n# The Ferryman\n\nThey follow the road until they hear the sound of a river, and soon enough they find it. The dark waters flow through a clearing where many trinkets, bones, and other strange offerings appeared to be tied to the trees.\n\nA small rowboat with a hooded ferryman stands on the shore. An imp sits on his back, picking at an open wound, twisting it\u2019s claws into the man. He calls out, \u201cYou must pay the toll! Something that you love and cherish!\u201d\\nRado presents an old spell pouch, and the ferryman seems satisfied.\n\nThey board the ship, and Bahruhn points to the dove he wears - \u201cHave you carried any who had this symbol?\u201d\\nThe ferryman chuckles darkly \u201cIn the dark city, light is smothered out by shadow. I have seen more of you, but I don\u2019t know what became of them.\u201d\n\nThe imp digs into the man\u2019s wound, causing him to fall to his knees in pain and cry out. The party slaps at the imp, and it disappears in a puff of smoke, leaving it\u2019s chain behind.\n\nThe ferryman says, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that\u2026 the pain is the only way I know I am still not taken by death.\u201d\n\nHe pulls back the hood and reveals rotting flesh clinging to a skeleton - he used to be a man, at some point long ago.\n\n\u201cWe are getting closer.\u201d he intones\n\n# The Gates of Duskmire\n\nThe boat moves slowly down the river, where it opens into a broader thoroughfare leading to a huge obsidian wall and gate. Surrounding the outside of the wall is a ring of gore, discarded bodies, rotting refuse, other offal piled up outside where scavengers pick at it and [undead buzzards](/doc/undead-buzzards-Uc0z6ODNRp) fly overhead.\n\nBeyond the great walls of this fortified city they can see a windmill on a hill, slowly turning, just as Bahruhn dreamed. Beyond it is a great black citadel, overlooking the black waters that flow through the dark city of Duskmire.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=95c2599f-35a9-4484-9a62-1569f6aa5bb8)",

They said I was [elfmarked](/doc/elfmarked-ohkfCOb0aT). My mother was a skilled thief and occasional sex-worker.  I was taught to be a pickpocket by her and initiated into the world of crime.  \n\nLater as an adult, I seduced the wrong man's wife in [Striborg](/doc/striborg-mZk9jSyJUV) and he put a price on my head, ostensibly for larceny, but we all know the real problem was that he looked like the wrong end of a pig.  I looked at my options and decided piracy fit my skillset and financial needs and I left town for a life on the sea, climbing rigging with ease and sailing all the seas of Pyora.  \n\nEventually my travels took me to [Duskmire](/doc/duskmire-hJey19lfsu) on a mission to deliver a message to the [Crimson Court](/doc/crimson-court-cofX8ha90z) from a pirate captain.  Afterwards I fell in love with a mysterious man who I learned, too late, was a [vampire](/doc/vampire-K6MjtAPLqz).  At first I begrudgingly gave my blood and then eventually I gave it in hopes of becoming a vampire myself. Finally he agreed and in the ritual of drinking my blood and turning my mortal body into an immortal vampire, he was attacked and murdered with a surge of dark magic for political reasons which I didn\u2019t understand at the time.  Caught between life and death, human and vampire, I became instead a Spectre with one foot in the realm of the living and one in the realm of the dead.",

When they attack, griffons are as swift and deadly as eagles, even as they strike with a lion's savage might and grace.\n\n***Horse Eaters.*** Griffons hunt in small prides, flying high over plains and forests near their rocky cliff-side aeries. Herd animals and horses are the prey they crave above all others, though they also hunt and kill hippogriffs. When it spots horses, a griffon screeches to alert its pride mates, which descend quickly toward their prey.\n\nThose riding or herding horses dread the griffon's piercing cry, preparing themselves for the bloody fight that inevitably follows. A griffon ignores a horse's rider when possible, and a rider that abandons its mount, or a herder that releases one or two horses, can escape unharmed while the griffon targets its chosen prey. Riders who attempt to protect their horses attract the full fury of an attacking griffon.\n\n***Sky Dwellers.*** Griffons lair in high rocky clifftop aeries, building their nests from sticks, leaves, and the bones of their prey. Once griffons establish a territory, they remain in that area until the food supply has been exhausted.\n\nAggressive and territorial, griffons engage in brutal aerial combat to defend their aeries, tearing and shredding the wings of flying intruders to send them spiraling to the ground. Creatures that climb to a griffon's lair are plucked from the cliffs and eaten, or are knocked from the heights to go tumbling to their deaths.\n\n***Trained Mounts.*** A griffon raised from an egg can be trained to serve as a mount. However, such training is time consuming, expensive (mostly for the ample food the creature requires), and dangerous. Expert trainers well versed in the griffon's legendary ferocity are typically the only ones able to raise these creatures safely.\n\nOnce trained, a griffon is a fierce and loyal steed. It bonds with one master for life, fighting to the death to protect that rider. A griffon mount retains its ravenous appetite for horseflesh, and a wise master ensures that a griffon remains satiated with other prey when passing through civilized lands.\n\n\n---\n\n* Source: [MM page 174](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#griffon_mm)\n\n[https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#griffon%5Fmm](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#griffon%5Fmm)\n\n\\\n",

After a chaotic battle, clever interrogation (and necromancy) revealed that the beer was meant for delivery to a windmill, likely for further fermentation and illicit delirium infusion. The group trashed most of the evidence, kept a barrel for research, scored loot, barely repaired the cart, made a tense return to town, and agreed to refocus on their original mission: finding the elusive eldritch lilies before their boss at the Amethyst Academy loses patience (and possibly their contract).\n\n### Key Points\n\n\n 1. We stake out the One Eyed Brewery from Old Lady Mabel's house and observe six dwarves loading barrels onto a wagon at night, acting suspiciously and avoiding torches.,\n 2. The Queen's Men are suspected of smuggling and have dwarven nationalist tattoos, with a reputation for criminal activity and possible ties to dwarven pirates and smugglers.,\n 3. We lack definitive proof of the Queen's Men's crimes and are gathering evidence to expose their operation and connections.,\n 4. We decide to follow the wagon stealthily, considering but rejecting sabotage or marking the kegs, to learn more about its destination and contacts.,\n 5. The wagon's tracks lead us into a corrupted forest filled with phosphorescent mushrooms and a purple-tinged delirium mist, indicating the area is tainted and hazardous.,\n 6. A piercing animal howl (wild boar) unnerves both the dwarves and us, causing the dwarves to hurry and become more alert.,\n 7. Craggy uses magic to destroy a wheel on the wagon, immobilizing it and causing the dwarves to panic and scramble.\n 8. A strange green/purple light and rhythmic chanting emanate from deeper in the woods, drawing the dwarves into a trance and away from the wagon.\n 9. We observe a ritual fire with magical lights and entranced dwarves; the fire is confirmed to be magical.,\n10. A dire boar ridden by a monstrous, hooded wereboar leader emerges, accompanied by spellcasting boars with a howl that stuns spellcasters and cancels spells.,\n11. The wereboar leader uses a potion of gaseous form to escape and is immune to charm effects; nonmagical weapons are less effective against these magical creatures.,\n12. We stabilize and interrogate a surviving Queen's Man, who reveals the ale was being delivered to a windmill on orders from Blackjack, destined for the 'brothers underground' (pale dwarves).,\n13. Speak with Dead confirms the ale was paid for by Blackjack, is spiked with delirium, and the windmill is a key delivery point for the operation.,\n14. Craggy's analysis reveals the seized ale is a first fermentation already spiked with delirium, intended for a second, stronger fermentation at the windmill.,\n15. River appears via magical scrying, expresses frustration at our delay, and reiterates that the Amethyst Academy's mission to find the eldritch lilies is of utmost importance and must take priority over local concerns.,\n16. We loot the battlefield, finding 535 gold (133 each), a +1 pike (Thrulrik), a potion of gaseous form, a vial of contaminated sludge, a bottle of migrant bitters (Craggy), and some dreamvine drugs.,\n17. We return to Amberwood Village, rest at the guard barracks, and request an estimate for a bathtub of liquid silver (quoted at 5,000 gold) to cure Theodore Marshall's lycanthropy, considering shrinking him to reduce the amount needed.,\n18. Craggy's insight reveals River's urgency comes from pressure within the Amethyst Academy to access the inscrutable tower in Gylmardin, with the Academy competing with other factions for delirium and eldritch lilies.\n19. The Queen's Men are working with the pale dwarves, delivering delirium-spiked ale to them via the windmill, motivated by more than just profit (possibly ideology or a larger plan). \n20. We confirm the windmill is a new location of interest and plan to travel to the city to pursue the main mission (finding the eldritch lilies), keeping an eye out for Queen's Men and opportunities to acquire silver.\n\n[full_transcript(3).txt 156842](/api/attachments.redirect?id=33f5256f-a7cf-468d-a39a-9d09ebbb0a71)\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=c010fbce-5695-4335-8328-5be5933c2372 \" =1024x1024\")",

      "content": " ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=a44a36d6-1957-43f4-af22-c7cbfd6f1245)\n\n# History\n\nThe floating pirate state of the hearthships has it\u2019s origins in the descendants of the shipbuilders and sailors who carried the [Dwarven Migration](/doc/dwarf-durandar-UOdggQRi6Y) across the Azure Sea.\n\nWhile historically the fleets were directly under the control of the [Durandian Kingdom](/doc/durandar-sWDxZHDVIC) and the [Arkwrights Guild](/doc/arkwrights-guild-xpUNyD7GMm), the confederacy was born when that official relationship ended. For their service in the Migration, the dwarvish King gave sailors a choice: citizenship and a pension in [Durandar](/doc/durandar-sWDxZHDVIC), or ownership of their hearthship. Those few who chose life on their ships ratified the first \u201cArticles of Agreement\u201d amongst themselves shortly after, marking the formal beginning of the Confederacy.\n\nIn current times, the confederacy operates as a loose alliance of pirates and other free-minded individuals who operate at sea and out of allied ports and pirate settlements in the north. While the majority of confederacy aligned ships and crews are dwarvish, anyone is free to join and many do.\n\n# Organization\n\nThe Confederacy is not a traditional nation-state, but a loosely organized alliance of sovereign ships that agree to a common oath. There is no single leader or central authority, instead confederates take their oaths very seriously and see it as their duty to enforce them among their own crews and fleets. Ships that are known to violate or act unworthy of their oaths can be voted out of the confederacy and marked as targets as punishment.\n\n### Articles of Agreement\n\nWhile each ship maintains it\u2019s own code, the common bond among all confederacy members is their allegiance to the Articles of Agreement, or \u201cConfederate\u2019s Oath\u201d. These articles outline the pirate\u2019s code of mutual defense, distribution of profits, operating guidelines for captain\u2019s councils, and standards for crew justice & discipline.\n\n### Leadership & Crews\n\n\n:::info\nSee @[Of Ship and Sea](mention://69049629-dbe5-4534-ac0a-9dffcb35e6d7/document/6e6318cf-1163-4725-8afc-a655d76c6ee2) for boat & crew rules\n\n:::\n\nEach ship is autonomous, and among the Azure Sea pirates this tends to follow two models - a hierarchy under the command of a captain, or a democratically organized crew who elect their leadership positions temporarily. Dwarven crews tend to follow the traditional hierarchy, handed down from the original Arkwrights, while those not as connected to the dwarven migration or operating out of [New Galmaarden](/doc/new-galmaarden-03tcpxxc2t) tend toward the democratic approach. \n\nWhatever way crews choose to organize themselves, when making decisions that affect a fleet of ships a temporary Council of Captains is called, with each ship sending a representative to represent their crews.\n\n### Operations\n\nThe pirates largely operate on friendly terms with [New Galmaarden](/doc/new-galmaarden-03tcpxxc2t) and smaller towns on their routes, while antagonizing or operating outside the law of the [Striborg Navy](/doc/striborg-navy-ndvIs6jZtX) that patrols the [Striborg](/doc/striborg-mZk9jSyJUV) Strait & southern Azure Sea waters. Much of the economic activity is bringing Durandian goods to market by evading their taxes. \n\nConfederate ships often take safe harbor in small pirate towns and settlements on the northernmost coasts furthest from Striborg. These towns often become centers for the Captain\u2019s Councils, often serving as seasonal destination for ships where business, sailor recruiting, and disputes are resolved among crews - serving as temporary, physical capitals for purposes of the Confederacy. The most famous of these is [Blue Harbour](/doc/blue-harbour-BvSEhfEXJ5).\n\n# Symbols\n\n[confederacy flag.mp4 720x544](/api/attachments.redirect?id=653a1260-fca9-4ad9-9b7b-b21eaa04c6df)\n\n**Flag**: A burning anchor on a black background\n\n# Known Affiliations\n\n[The Storm Barons](/doc/storm-barons-9bIflGjrAd) are usually referred to as a \u201csplinter group\u201d, although they are known to fly under the flag of the Confederacy and participate in their Councils on occasion.

Far below, the twisting streets of the [Outer Circle](/doc/outer-circle-wpbygPZiuW) wind through the shadows and flickering torchlight that penetrate the gloom. This part of the city is encased on the western side by the obsidian gates, and to the east, the Saltmarsh River flows like a black ribbon slowly past the old windmill and through another black gate - the castle of [Lady Nightshade](/doc/lady-nightshade-3kjLNj2Zbs), like a dark throne upon the landscape, her [Crimson Court](/doc/crimson-court-cofX8ha90z) and the vampire estates clustered around it.*\\n\\n*You stand in an austere waiting room, white walls unadorned with any art except an black eye chiseled from obsidian - the symbol of this dhampir estate. Several hard backed, mahogany chairs are lined up neatly in front of a blood red door. You are waiting for your audience with the warden of this estate: Velryn \u201cthe Bloodhound\u201d Blackthorn.*\n\nThe party gathers here, meeting for the first time. As they introduce themselves, they are summoned by [Velryn](/doc/velryn-blackthorn-bgx7zYW1b0) - a bent, bald man walks with a cane and a pronounced limp, and his body bears the scars not of some injury, but of some sort of torture.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=c2d5af2c-3764-47ce-ba09-aef330c03558)\n\n*\"Thank you for waiting.

But lately, there are those who think they can escape my gaze\u2026.*\\n\\n*\u201dTell me friend\u201d he says in a manner that implies menace \u201cwhat do you know of the false god [Sarenrae](/doc/sarenrae-W8XCSaoR45)?\u201d*\n\nThe party knows only that it is a blasphemous cult of the light that uses the symbol of a dove - a foul thing here in the dark city.\n\n*\u201cThey will not operate under my watchful eye here.

You will be greatly rewarded if you bring them back alive\u2026.\u201d he grins his broken tooth grin \u201cI have some special things planned for them in my dungeon\u2026.\u201d*\n\nThe party asks where they should start, and Velryn informs them they are not the first to attempt this task. His last \u201cgroup of hounds\u201d was last seen tracking down clues at a tavern known as [The Black Chalice](/doc/the-black-chalice-liXC2cnejj). He also warns them, *\u201cThere are those in Duskmire who have their own ambitions - ambitions that may lead them to do something unwise, like harbor this treasonous filth. Be careful.\u201d*\n\nVelryn summons his captive assistant, a skeleton who carries his skull under his arm - \u201cYes Master? I have some goodies for them I think they will like\u2026 after the failure of the last group, my newest experiment\u2026.\u201d\n\nHe puts his head down on the floor and rummages through a wooden chest, withdrawing several [Vials of Dark Resolve](/doc/vial-of-dark-resolve-hdap6jS2a8), a [Cloak of Rats](/doc/cloak-of-rats-iHIvQwaOt1), and [Amulet of False Life](/doc/amulet-of-false-life-vuSsCyR2g0).  Velryn then orders the skeleton, \u201cYou yourself will assist them\u201d The skeleton hands over [his skull](/doc/soulbound-skull-DNlBi2UMIZ) to the party.\n\n# The Streets\n\nThe party descends to ground level and steps out into the damp streets of Duskmire, where a light drizzle has begun. They make their way north, along the River, towards the labyrinth neighborhood of non-human tenements and slums. Along the way they see a figure with a beaked plague mask pushing a cart of dead bodies stuck in the mud. Thaddeus gives him a hand, and the appreciative worker gives the party some confusing directions to The Black Chalice.\n\n## Ole Boudreaux\u2019s Purple Bazaar\n\n ![Ole Boudreaux](/api/attachments.redirect?id=4aaa6c9d-f74f-4456-81ea-98105e55cd23 \"right-50 =253x253\")They attempt to make their way into the maze of alleys. At a crossroads, they find a shop with a purple taxidermy [beholder](/doc/beholder-zombie-98ylojBtWx) in the window. They decide to check out and ask for directions again, and a deep [gnome](/doc/gnome-rock-ARFvDASnZz) with 9 eyes painted (?) on his face appears from behind the counter, smoking a pipe of his own [dream vine](/doc/dream-vine-viEBw5FxT7) blend and blowing purple smoke rings.  He introduces himself as [Ole Boudreaux](/doc/ole-boudreaux-JAQa03P0Gp). The party finds out that he only deals in purple items, much to their amusement. When they ask if anyone associated with \u201cthe doves\u201d has been seen around here, he answers that an older woman with a dove brooch came by looking for ritual herbs, but he didn\u2019t have all that she needed. The party inquires where she might have gone to find what she needed, and he tells them \u201c[Talindra](/doc/talindra-u3RJTStFtn) - the merchant - she is the one who brings in the shipments of all kinds of things.\u201d The party thanks him, buys some purple trinkets, and heads out into the streets. Boudreaux warns them to watch out for [zombie raccoons](/doc/zombie-raccoon-kRMzfO1jg9).\n\n## Raccoons\n\nThe party lights a lantern as they make their way further into the maze of alleys. They come to find a single human finger lying in the middle of the lane, and as they pick it up they see several raccoons with red eyes circling around the edge of their lamp light. They pick it up and attempt to feed the finger to the raccoon, and as they do so another sneaks up behind them and steals a set of manacles from their pocket. They are able to recover it with more bribes to bring the raccoons out of their trash pile, and they scamper off into the darkness.\n\n## The Black Chalice\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=cfca8e6a-4341-45c4-b7e7-d68b85a65bbe)Following Boudreaux\u2019s directions, they finally come to the tavern with it\u2019s glowing red chalice in the window. Inside the light is dim, red and there are several people seated at candlelit tables around the bar - some human, some vampire, some dhampir. They see a burly dhampir man wearing a leather jacket having a whiskey at the bar, and Zhilwad sidles up to see if he can buy him a drink and ask some questions. The party sees that he is wearing a brooch of his own estate - a cat silhouetted against a full moon. Realizing he is quite drunk, they chat him up and he reveals that his name is [Jorek](/doc/jorek-zwTvrSOGgc), son of the merchant Talindra, and that he just finished up his shift at their warehouse, \u201cMy old lady wanted me to clear everything out of there, that warehouse is kind of a shithole right by the river. That\u2019s why I deserve a drink!\u201d They cheers him and buy another round. He is easily convinced to show them his handiwork, and they all set off into the night a little wobbly.\n\n## Hollering Spiders\n\nAs Jorek leads the way, he suddenly comes to a stop and looks up. \u201cOh shi-\u201d he attempts to say as he is engulfed in spider webs and goes careening upwards into the night. Several [evil looking spiders](/doc/holler-spider-uQ0yNihlLU) scurry down the walls of this narrow alley and begin screaming unholy shrieks and spitting acid at our besieged party. While they crawl and leap around, dodging attacks, Bertrand transforms into his human-beast form and lays several heavy blows down on these insects while the rest of the party flings spells and attacks at them.\n\nWhen the dust settles, Jorek is gone. The party looks up and sees the tops of these tenements are covered in spiderwebs, like a giant nest.\n\n## Crime Scene\n\n> *As you turn a corner, you find yourselves on a street that has been cordoned off by the authorities - polished black stone humanoid sentinels, glowing with red arcane runes. Lying on the cobblestones are a half-dozen corpses, seemingly the victims of some terrible skirmish. Sentinels have disarmed and arrested three blood-drenched humans and are in the midst of packing the bodies on to carts. One of the officers sees you. \"Get on,\" you hear the noise manifest around you rather than the thing speaking \"Nothing to see here.\"*\n\nThey turn a corner and come to a cordoned off crime scene - several [obsidian automatons](/doc/bloodless-sentinels-UAT4Khzzp1) are doing crowd control and carting away a half dozen bodies that appear to have died in some sort of street fight. As the party approaches they immediately see that some of these dead humans are wearing dove brooches - while others are wearing the now familiar markers of the Outer Circle estates - this one a raccoon.\n\nThaddeus transforms himself into the image of cart pusher they saw earlier, with his beaked mask. They approach the black sentinels \u201cCITIZENS, DISPERSE, EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL\u201d but Thaddus explains he\u2019s there to take the bodies. They let him through the cordon and he pushes them out and down the street as the party follows. They search the bodies and take the brooches - 2 raccoons, 2 doves - and a few trinkets and gold coins from the pockets of the deceased.\n\n# The Warehouse\n\n ![Mother Yara, the Dawnbringer](/api/attachments.redirect?id=c34ec06e-bac9-4b61-897c-b29c3c6bb243)\n\nWithout their guide, they decide to just head in the direction of the river and low and behold, they turn a corner and see a dilapidated warehouse precariously leaning over the retaining wall that separates the buildings from the river. On the wall in faded paint is the symbol of Talindra & Jorek\u2019s estate - the black cat.\n\nThey see a light on in an upstairs window. They go around the building and see a small boat pulled up to the dock of the warehouse, and most of the doors are barricaded shut with painted warnings to keep out.\n\nDonna uses her [Cloak of Rats](/doc/cloak-of-rats-iHIvQwaOt1) to polymorph and slip under one of the doors. Inside the warehouse she finds some scattered boxes in the loading area - chewing through them she sniffs out some ritual herbs and finds weapons packed into barrels with straw.\n\nWhile she explores, the others go to the north side of the building and decide to don the brooches - they plan to knock and see who opens, pretending to be on the side of whoever answers and the other two will be \u201cprisoners\u201d. They do so, and an angry mage answers: \u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d Seeing the brooches he says \u201cOh ok, well what\u2019s the password?\u201d Not knowing, they blame the lack of training for new Sarenrae recruits and the mage commiserates. They ask him to step outside and help them bring in the prisoners, but as they do so Zhilwad slips his hand over the mages mouth while they manacle and knock him out out of sight of the other cult members.\n\nThey then bring the \u201cprisoners\u201d into the warehouse where a gray haired woman - obviously the leader, who introduces herself as [Mother Yara](/doc/mother-yara-dawnbringer-4dR2aoAXG6). The cultists have built a large altar in the warehouse to Sarenrae and are busily preparing herbs and other components of their ritual. A war priest approaches them and tells them \u201cMake the prisoners kneel over there, when we give the word, slit their throats.\u201d Bertrand and Santrini kneel. Donna sneaks into the warehouse, still a rat.\n\n ![Santrini takes out Mother Yara with an impossible blow](/api/attachments.redirect?id=045372cf-7e11-4e31-a133-07a6f734c567)As they are ordered to slit the prisoners throats, everyone draws their weapons, drops the manacles, and attacks the surprised cultists. Santrini immediately goes for Mother Yara and knocks her out in the first round. The war priest responds by shooting blinding light, the assassin gets in his sneak attacks, and the veteran soldier overturns a flaming brazier from above but it is not enough. As the vicious fight ensues the party gets the upper hand. As the cultists begin to drop, the assassin makes a dash for Mother Yara, attempting to rescue her and drag her to safety. \u201cTHE DAWN IS COMING!!!\u201d he screams.\n\nThe party knocks him out, and is able to bring Mother Yara and her rogue bound and unconscious back to the Eye\u2026",

Her mother died when Sigr\u00fan was seven, lost in childbirth while bringing the youngest brother into the world. From that day forward, expectations hardened around her: she was to be dutiful, quiet, and useful in ways deemed proper for a daughter. Her father, grief-stricken and rigid, turned his attention to his sons and assumed Sigr\u00fan would follow a gentler path like her mother once had.\n\nSigr\u00fan did not.\n\nStrong-willed and broad-shouldered, capable of growing a thick beard like many dwarves, she attempted to join the Durander navy as both shipwright and soldier, disguising herself as a man. For a time, the lie held. She learned hull repair, rigging, discipline, and battle. When she was discovered, she was expelled in disgrace \u2014 quietly, but decisively. The navy wanted no scandal.\n\nHer father never learned the truth. He believed Sigr\u00fan worked honestly as a flora curator in the [Arkwright\u2019s Guild](/doc/arkwrights-guild-xpUNyD7GMm), specializing in the cultivation of plants used in high-quality woven baskets, just as her mother had done in her youth. Sigr\u00fan let him believe it. It was easier than admitting how far she had already drifted from the life chosen for her.\n\nCast out and desperate for coin, Sigr\u00fan took work at the docks, repairing ships \u2014 often those no respectable guild would touch. Smugglers, debt-runners, unlucky captains. It was there she met Helgi, a young man burdened with a legacy that had curdled into misfortune. He had inherited a rundown cog ship \u2014 once named the *Overflowing Coffer* \u2014 and the crushing debts of a formerly celebrated mercantile family, bankrupted under his uncle\u2019s disastrous stewardship and now infamous for ruin.\n\nSigr\u00fan repaired Helgi\u2019s ship when few others would. Impressed by her skill and grit, Helgi hired her on as his personal boatswain. He handled trade and ledgers; she kept the ship afloat and the crew alive. Mutual respect turned to fondness, fondness to love. In time, they became engaged, planning to leave Durander behind and marry at sea, beyond the reach of debt collectors and bitter kin.\n\nSigr\u00fan\u2019s father discovered both the engagement and the years-long lie his daughter had lived. Enraged and humiliated, he hired a captain \u2014 one still owed debts from Helgi\u2019s ancestors \u2014 to intercept Helgi\u2019s ship on the night of the eloping wedding. He sailed with five of Sigr\u00fan\u2019s brothers, intent on killing Helgi and reclaiming his daughter by force.\n\nThe ambush failed.\n\nAs a violent storm broke over the sea, Helgi fought back with desperate fury, killing Sigr\u00fan\u2019s father and five of her brothers amid the chaos. But the youngest brother, Dagr, had hidden aboard as a stowaway, waiting to strike should the attack falter. As the storm raged, Dagr stabbed Helgi from behind.\n\nSigr\u00fan struck Dagr down in return, mortally wounding him \u2014 but the ship lurched violently. Both Dagr and Helgi were thrown into the churning waves below. Sigr\u00fan lunged to save her husband, but before she could reach him, lightning struck her helm, blasting her into darkness.\n\nShe awoke alone on the shore. The ship was shattered. Helgi was gone.\n\nHunted for the deaths of her family and burdened with the debts of her husband, Sigr\u00fan abandoned her name. She re-emerged adopting the alias K\u00e1ra Leiptrborinn \u2014 *Lightning-Born*. The strike had changed her: her hair turned from black to pale gold, her eyes from green to storm-blue. Blue tattoos, wavelike and jagged as lightning, now traced across much of her body, as if the storm itself had claimed her flesh.\n\nK\u00e1ra returned to the wreck of the cog and set herself to rebuilding it. Nearly every board, sail, and rope was replaced. The ship was renamed to keep a low profile \u2014 and because so little of the original remained. K\u00e1ra resolved to rebuild not only the vessel, but her future: to earn coin, to one day settle her debts, and to reclaim credibility on her own terms.\n\nShe sought out a captain not bound by guilds or fear, eventually finding a well-spoken individual with the capital to fund the repairs. Together, they began sailing under false papers and shifting banners, taking dangerous work others would not \u2014 smuggling, discreet trade, and voyages skirting the edges of the law.\n\nK\u00e1ra now sails with a hard-won code: the seas must remain free of tyranny, and no power \u2014 king, guild, or bloodline \u2014 has the right to chain another\u2019s course. She is no hero, and no villain. She is a survivor of storm and betrayal, lightning in her blood, salt in her lungs, and freedom ever on the horizon.\n\n\\\n[Kara_L6.pdf 14347491](/api/attachments.redirect?id=73e4e6d3-acfa-4b81-abbf-16c28ada8018)\n\n\\\n",

No motivation.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDay 8. \u00a0I remember what I did yesterday, which was nothing.  What have I been doing in the way of hygiene? \u00a0Clearly, I am taking my meals here. This storeroom has plenty of pres\n\nThe bread! How is this possible? \u00a0I must have been hiding in this location for many days now, and the bread has not a trace of mold! \u00a0My perception of the passing of time must be faulty.  But how can that be? \u00a0If I cannot be trusted to observe the fall of night... I will put this thought aside. \u00a0There is nothing to be gained by questioning one's sanity--it must be taken at face value.\n\nIt occurs to me that when I remember \u201cyesterday\u201d, it could be any previous day\u2014if I am not diligent with note taking.  Even today, I fluctuated between excitement and paralysis.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*\u2026 the collection of entropic motes. \u00a0Experimenters shall work in quartets. \u00a0A pair is required to operate the polarizing arms, while a third positions the chamber.

Vigilance in the vicinity of entropic motes is advised; the effects of personal contact with such phenomenon are of course unpredictable.  Likewise, attention to the vectors of hyper-sensorial obliviata should not be neglected\u2026*\n\n\\\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\u00a0\n\nDay 10. \u00a0I went outside to find help. \u00a0A mistake. \u00a0I still felt the urge to hide but decided to test the hypothesis that I was suffering from paranoia. \u00a0The gloom is persistent. \u00a0Easier to move undetected but also easier to be ambushed. \u00a0I heard voices down the alley. \u00a0Fear gripped me but I forced myself to move toward the sound. \u00a0Followed for 80 paces. \\[insert landmark\\].\u00a0Then the sound of running footsteps, a group coming towards me. \u00a0I turned back and hid amongst wreckage. \u00a0Shouting, running, went past and continued. \u00a0Then yelling, impacts, steel, screams. \u00a0I stayed hidden until dark then returned.\u00a0 Lucky I could find my way back\u2026\n\n\\\nDay 11.\u00a0 Pleased that I remember the past four days. I am lucky that I regained cognizance in this pantry.  I wouldn't have found it otherwise. The entire second floor of the building had previously collapsed and smothered the entrance with debris. \u00a0It occurs to me now that the more often I pass through the exit hole through the rubble, the greater the chances of being detected. The bandits in the region must be adept trackers.\n\nI should critically consider how a scavenger might gain access. \u00a0The collapsed hallway is clearly impenetrable, but the oak door might not be. \u00a0It feels jammed but also locked.\u00a0 I am unlikely to find a key.\u00a0 Picking the lock may be a futile task for me, but for a catburglar?\n\n\\\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\u00a0\n\n*Cohort One*\n\n*Lugorf Hattenfuld*\n\n*Darienne Alschabane*\n\n*Iric Edelwark*\n\n*Lavender*\n\n\u00a0\n\n*Cohort Two*\n\n*Chardus Zamph*\n\n*Ejilah Gandrabash*\n\n*Hasenka Talfalef*\n\n*Calandora Applenap*\n\n*Kuriz Balasu*\n\n\u00a0\n\n*Cohort Three*\n\n*Gellix Emberheart*\n\n*Quavence Stillwater*\n\n*Matlen Zhilvo*\n\n*Kules Vayle*\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\u00a0\n\nDay 15. \u00a0It is disheartening that I do not seem to be making much progress in my short-term memory. \u00a0So unintuitive!  I remember all my recipes, every tincture and balm, extract and reduction, incantation and mental posture, but how did I get to wherever this is? \u00a0I remember my childhood, the cottage in Loddering, the tenement in [Striborg](/doc/striborg-mZk9jSyJUV), the Guild. \u00a0But then nothing. \u00a0I feel as one does after a vivid and stimulating dream, and then upon walking, find every detail lost, left only with a vague impression, color, flavor, note.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDay 16. \u00a0Right under my nose this whole time. \u00a0Under the empty cider barrel, folded in soiled clothes\u2014 a collection of papers. \u00a0They appear to be a previous attempt at keeping a journal.\n\nI feel ill, my stomach has dropped to the floor. \u00a0More than twenty days of entries\u2014forgotten.\u00a0 Is the situation hopeless?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\\n*Doctrine of recent times treats Gaian energies as pristine sources, steadfast, incapable of imperfection. \u00a0In contrast I posit that these energies are far from immutable, and indeed wax and wane, thrive and languish. \u00a0I suggest an analogous model, that of man; that ley lines be conceived, if you will, as humours of the Earth, both indicative of and subject to the health of the entity\u2026* \u00a0\n\n\\\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\u00a0\n\nDay 17. \u00a0I have partial memory of yesterday's events. \u00a0Fingers the same. \u00a0Fortunately, the feeling of hopelessness from yesterday's entry has largely been forgotten (or accepted?) \u00a0I will devote the day to studying the notes.\n\nA most intriguing discovery!  Among the journal entries are what appear to be the remains of another set of writings.\u00a0 Instructions for some kind of monumental ritual. \u00a0A page lists the names of participants\u2014my name is included! \u00a0And Matlen.\u00a0 We were childhood friends. \u00a0I helped get him into the Guild. \u00a0And Lavender!! (who could forget her!\u2014though I can\u2019t recall from where I know her\u2026)\u00a0\n\nWhat happened?\u00a0 Did we complete the ritual?\u00a0 Was this the cause of my condition?\u00a0 It seems likely. \u00a0It must be.\u00a0 But what to do?\u00a0 At some point I will need to search for more remnants.\n\nevening: I realize I must have hidden the writings.\u00a0 Why?\n\n\\\nDay 18.\u00a0 A thought: with each entry, the act of pouring over repetitive gibberish becomes more tedious and confusing. \u00a0Did I hide the papers from frustration? \u00a0Unlikely.\u00a0 The good news is my writing proficiency has improved\u2014or perhaps the stunted nature of my previous language is illusory, that I adopted a more concise writing style to reduce the burden of review?\u00a0 Also unlikely.\u00a0 I\u2019m projecting my current feeling. \u00a0Regardless, I must begin an instruction set that reduces collective musings to definite courses of action.\n\n\\\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\\n*...activator: a blend of 40 parts lemure essence, 5 parts Yggdrasil sap, 1 part primordial deva bile.

On the way to work I see. Another day finding new homes for the dead, eh?\u201d\n\nJorg: \u2014\n\nQuavence: \u201c\u2026Yes, well um, I don\u2019t suppose you would mind some company? I am at an impasse in my research, and I think it might help to step away for a bit. I could lend a hand as well. I\u2019m not totally unfamiliar with physical labor\u2026\u201d\n\nJorg raises an eyebrow.\n\nQuavence: \u201c\u2026Yes, well then. Do you have an extra pitchfork?\u201d\n\nAfter a moment, Jorg tosses a hook into his cart.\n\nQuavence: \u201cOf course. Well, don\u2019t let me slow you down. Shall we be off?\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAfternoon. Jorg and Quavence return with a cart of corpses.\n\nQuavence: \u201cWell that was quite interesting! You are indeed a master of the trade. Quite impressive the way you are able to throw those bodies in the air. I definitely learned a thing or two observing your technique. I must admit, the hook is not as simple as you would expect, but I feel like I was getting the hang of it in the last hour. We should definitely do this again sometime.\u201d\n\nJorg: \u2014\n\nQuavence: \u201cSo\u2026before you go\u2026um, I was hoping you could do me a favor. As you must be aware, I am a scholar of physiology\u2014anatomy\u2014how the organs and muscles and bones are all put together and how they work in concert\u2026 So, this situation with the Haze provides a fascinating opportunity for study. True, I have dissected many bodies before, but I don\u2019t need to tell you that there is no substitute for lifelong learning!\u2026And so, I was wondering if it would be possible if you could spare one of these corpses. I would treat it with all respect due the dead of course! Preferably one with all its limbs, if possible?\u2026and perhaps large and muscular, like say, that one there?\u201d\n\nJorg stares at Quavence with squinted eyes, then finally rolls a corpse off the cart.\n\nQuavence: \u201cPerfect! You have done me a great service!\u2026um, would you have a minute to help me drag him to that shack over there? No?\u2014alright. Then I\u2019ll see you again soon\u2026\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\u201cNow my beautiful, what shall we call you?\u201d\n\n\\\n",

Villagers huddle close, going about their business, casting an eye to the full moon that rises over the [Dreadwood](/doc/dreadwood-GcfKdBzGyT). Mists tinged with magic swirl above it's dark trees, like psychadelic fingers grasping towards the heavens. The people of [Saltmarsh](/doc/saltmarsh-GkGI6ISio5) share worried glances as they go about their business here in the main street now growing quiet as the shadows grow longer.*\\n\\n*You have been summoned to the Commodore's house, to discuss this matter. You arrive at a well pointed two story house, surrounded by an iron gate and well tended gardens. Candles flicker warmly in the windows.*\\n\\n*Two guards stand at attention at the gate.*\n\nThe assembled party has been called upon by [Commodore Daniel Warrington](/doc/commodore-daniel-warrington-OHzOMkhMHS) for some freelance work. They get checked in by the guards at the gate, chatting about the rumors. Bertrand looks around and notices the smell of fresh paint, and what appears to be new fencing around the Commodore\u2019s gardens. The front door looks like it\u2019s been recently replaced.\n\nThe Commodore\u2019s wife greets them & escorts them up a grand staircase to the Commodore\u2019s office, offering them tea. They knock at the door and the Commodore calls them in.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=39115b80-b45e-4d48-8ba2-10220eed5c29)A roaring fire greets them, so much so the party begins to sweat. The Commodore seems unphased, energetic even, and beckons them to sit in the luxurious leather chairs here. \u201cThank you for coming, I see we have assembled the town\u2019s finest\u2026\u201d as he sizes up Bertrand, an obvious veteran, and he sneers a little \u201ceven you, sorceress\u201d directed at Nav. He does not stop to listen to her paladin explanation. \u201cNo matter! What must be done is these rumors must be put to an end. I suspect bandits, or bears, or bandits dressed as bears. They do that sometimes\u2026.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe town is up in arms - there are a superstitious lot! We cannot have any more unrest but I cannot spare the men, you see my problem?\u201d\n\nThe party asks him about the sightings and attacks and it becomes clear the Commodore\u2019s intention is not to root out any supposed monsters, but to bring an end to the rumors. The party asks about the attacks:\n\n\u201cOh yes, the farmer [Hayley](/doc/hayley-Q25bAxYagK) out at the edge of town - her partner has gone missing and of course everyone is jumping to conclusions. I\u2019m not saying you need to make a grand rescue or anything, but finding an explanation for that would go a long way I think.\u201d\n\nNav uses her divine sense, and finds that this house has been desecrated sometime recently.\n\nBertrand looks nervously out the window at the slowly growing twilight. They exit to the street.\n\n## The Empty Net\n\nThe party discusses heading out to the farm. Several [Iron Rider knights](/doc/iron-rider-knight-JIpk2Tegm7) pass by with lanterns, on patrol for the beast! Bertrand nervously runs away into the shelter of the nearby bar - [The Empty Net](/doc/the-empty-net-NwapU8Z8Za) - so that they don\u2019t see his hybrid form. The party follows, thinking it good to acquire some local knowledge.\n\nInside the bar, Bertrand grabs a tablecloth with a flourish and pulls it out like a magician, leaving the tankards and plates sitting in place. Several people applaud as Bertrand wraps himself in it, the drunkards thinking it some kind of performance. \n\n ![Kreb Shenker, proprietor of The Empty Net](/api/attachments.redirect?id=90bdbf7e-0507-47ef-8231-dc8e40189a48 \"right-50 =299x299\")Kidrinn sidles up to the bar followed by Nav, and the gruff bartender [Kreb Shenker](/doc/kreb-shenker-ya5uvzqUn9) pours them a weak ale while chomping on his cigar. A band of dwarves, clearly many beers deep into their evening, cheers Kidrinn and one named [Caspian](/doc/caspian-the-motherless-cNaoIg05cn) asks if he\u2019s in on a ship. Kidrinn sizes them up as unemployed miners and buys a round, asking if they know anything about *the beast* and they oblige him with tall tales about \u201cthe devil running around with demon children in the woods.\u201d They swear they are going to go out and look for the devil, as soon as they finish these beers. \n\nNav orders something stronger, and gets a Durandian [Berserker\u2019s Draught](/doc/berserkers-draught-sn5rNNx4Lp). She asks Kreb what he\u2019s heard about the farmer\u2019s wife going missing. He says he hears a lot of bullshit all day, but he does know Claire - she supplies the tavern with cocktail herbs. Last time she was here, she said she had seen weird animals in the woods. And then she disappeared.\n\n# Hayley\u2019s Farm\n\nOn the dark road out to the farm, the party is ambushed by [zombie raccoons](/doc/zombie-raccoon-kRMzfO1jg9). Kidrinn hears a noise and goes to investigate, only to have one jump out of a bush and attempt to grapple him. They fight these undead beasts until they fall, and then fall again. Bertrand goes a little nuts and stomps one into the ground. They examine what\u2019s left of the carcasses and Kidrinn discovers what appears to be\u2026. a collar? Like a pet. They know that zombie raccoons are a sign of infected carrion in the area.\n\n## Hayley\n\nThey approach the farm, which though shrouded in darkness they can make out the giant forms of pumpkins growing everywhere, the vines tangling around the footpaths that lead to the modest farmhouse. They knock, and the tiny gnome hatch opens and the bereaved looking Hayley asks them \u201cOh does the town care now?\u201d she does not trust the party, but tells them that Hayley went into the outskirts of the Dreadwood and never returned. Before she disappeared - they were having trouble with strange animals coming after the pumpkins in the night.\n\nThe party says they will find her if they can, and hope to return to prove their sincerity.\n\n# [Dreadwood](/doc/dreadwood-GcfKdBzGyT)\n\nThey follow a footpath into the dark woods, and through the trees they see a campfire burning invitingly. They approach a ground of wagons and find only\u2026 corpses, mutilated -  bloody, child-sized footprints - and evidence of cannibalism - a horrific scene. It looks like these people were killed recently, the blood still fresh. The tiny footprints, surrounded by those of a large beast, leading further into the dark wood\u2026.\n\nThe party makes their way through [swarms of bats](/doc/swarms-of-bats-DLMVo2cXg1) and fog.\n\nThey sneak up on a clearing. Several huge pumpkins loom before a large bonfire. A werewolf holds a bound body high above it, while several [constructed doll children](/doc/constructed-doll-children-8Qx5vtfks6) clamor for it hungrily.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=01787a4f-bacd-4ced-8def-7a76ed4c3e0e)They party attacks - Bertrand goes wolf to wolf with the [werewolf](/doc/werewolf-rSNn9Oz710), trading bites and claw attacks. The werewolf looks him in the eye, *We could be pack, brother! Give in and we can hunt together!*\u201d Kidrinn makes a run for the bound body, thrown aside. He slashes his way through the construct children to aid the woman, just as one of the dolls takes a bite of flesh from her. Nav misty steps into the middle of the fray, reigning blows and the werewolf responds, \u201c*Disgusting sorceress!\u201d* and Nav is knocked down.\n\nAt this point the tide turns, Nav revives herself and Bertrand takes down the feral werewolf. As the beast falls, it transforms, shrinks, the hair recedes and they are left with\u2026\u2026 [Commodore Daniel Warrington](/doc/commodore-daniel-warrington-OHzOMkhMHS) lying unconscious on the ground!\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=0a3b7348-85aa-4d0a-b178-f2e8704aa427)They bind the Commodore, and return to Hayley\u2019s farm with her wife Claire safe and sound. Hayley thanks them, and apologizes for doubting their intentions. She gifts them a Moon Scythe in return.\n\nThe party decides to take the bound Commodore back to the [Gold Scale Co.](/doc/gold-scale-company-m1WdlmIYwP) to decide what to do with him.",

There is a lot of variety with these so it\u2019s nice to mix some in. If you resize it correctly, they use the same base as the TrueTiles. ex:\n  * [OpenForge Dungeon Risers](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3640692) - add height to your tiles\n  * [OpenForge Traps](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4057240) \n\n\\\n",

If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or have its speed halved and have disadvantage on Dexterity-based checks and saving throws for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n***Hideous Feast.*** The bloated ghoul feeds on a corpse within 5 feet of it that is less than 1 week old. It regains 1d8 hit points per size category of the creature it consumes. For example, the ghoul regains 1d8 hit points when consuming a Tiny creature or 4d8 hit points when consuming a Large creature. The bloated ghoul can't use Hideous Feast on a corpse if it or another bloated ghoul has already used Hideous Feast on the corpse.\n\n## Bloated Ghoul\n\nBloated ghouls are ghouls who have engaged in ritual gorging on the flesh of hundreds of humanoids, their bodies swelling with undigested meat and bone. They eventually become pot-bellied undead maddened with hunger. A bloated ghoul's home is often slick with spilled blood and guts, which it happily licks off the floor and walls.\n\n***Hungry Dead Nature.*** The ghoul doesn't require air or sleep.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Source: [Tome of Beasts 2 page 166](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#bloated%20ghoul_tob2)\n\n[https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#bloated%20ghoul%5Ftob2](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#bloated%20ghoul%5Ftob2)\n\n\\\n",

The road here is alive with murmurs\u2014hushed voices of the humans who pass by blending with the distant sound of horse hooves and the shuffle of boots on cobblestone - slowly approaching.*\\n\\n*Shadows dance under the flickering light of the wrought-iron lanterns, they sputter in time with the bootsteps, taking on a sickly sapphire tinge. The people around you stop, a wave of tense silence sweeping over the crowd, and all eyes turn as a procession approaches.*\\n\\n*Two skeletal horses lead - atop each you see two knights. One, the familiar face of [Amelia](/doc/amelia-mAibH1T0Em), her red dress one of the only spots of color in this dismal place. Beside her, a knight in black armor, smoke slowly pouring from the gaps in his metal plates, their visor down. The scent of burning flesh fills the air as they approach.*\\n\\n*Behind them, the [Bloodless Sentinels](/doc/bloodless-sentinels-UAT4Khzzp1) - statuesque and lifeless, march in perfect unison, their stone hands hoisting an ornate coach draped in black. Atop the coach, a purple banner adorned with the sigil of [Duskmire](/doc/duskmire-hJey19lfsu) - a windmill - flutters in the stagnant air.*\\n\\n*The procession halts, and for a moment it seems as if even the river holds it\u2019s breath. The coach door opens, releasing a thin mist that pours out reaching for the earth.*\\n\\n*Out steps Lady Nightshade, unmistakable, her face covered by a black funeral veil - but her terrible necklace of hearts, skewered on silver chain, slowly beating. The knights dismount and join her by her side, their eyes downcast in reverence.*\\n\\n*Lady Nightshade walks towards a temple across the street - a symbol of a rising moon on it\u2019s facade. Outside is a hastily assembled altar - burning black candles, bunches of [sapphire nightshade](/doc/sapphire-nightshade-Qvbjiqksvy) flowers, a few coins.*\\n\\n*\u201dFor those souls we lost, for the tithes they can no longer give, let us pray to [Selune](/doc/selune-wFfmk6l5Ba) that we shall be joined again in the lunar kingdom where night is forever.\u201d*\n\nThe party is reunited by the side of the Saltmarsh River after the chaos of the bombing. They recount their adventures since the last time they spoke, and came up with many theories on what\u2019s going on here. They see little flotillas going past them, ghouls and skeletons chained to rafts of inflated pigskins - no use for feeding to the crocodile, and not big enough to carry them unseen. As they are talking, they hear bootsteps in lockstep unison coming their way. Around them, everyone kneels instinctively. Mimicking the crowd, the party makes themselves inconspicuous as the Lady comes to pay her respects.\n\nAs quickly as the procession came, the veiled Lady reboards her carriage and they are gone, marching off northward.\n\n## Ama\u2019s Answer\n\nAs they stand up and watch the knights and Lady leave, a jet black raven with one eye that shimmers like liquid silver lands on the stone fence nearest Ama. It jangles it\u2019s leg mischeviously at Ama, a small paper tied with a ribbon. She takes it and reads:\n\n> \u201c*The moon\u2019s madness grows stronger. The path you seek is treacherous, but the faeries hold truths unknown to mortals. Seek their help in Glimmervale before the night swallows all\u201d*\n>\n> \\n\u2014 Olrissa\n\nThe party decides if they want to survive here, or make their way to the [Inner Circle](/doc/inner-circle-iVSnGQFWfT), they are going to have to find allies or something to help them. They decide to visit the Ebonveil Estates - the neighborhood of dhampir castles and mansions - and look to see where the humans go, and the meaning of the insignias they carry.\n\n# House Talindra\n\nThey make their way through the city streets to the high walled gardens of [Ebonveil Estates](/doc/ebonveil-estates-3Z3KWu7OBV). They see the insignias mirrored on their great gates - the signs of the houses here. They approach the gate and inside see a well manicured garden, trees blooming in the twilight. They discuss their cover story: that Greyson is starting his own blood tithe estate and is interested in acquiring property in Duskmire (they noticed there\u2019s no hotels, maybe a market need?). They find no gate, so Greyson tries the gate\u2026 unlocked. Strange, since the high walls look so imposing. Pushing the gate in, they see bootprints in the mud\u2026 blood\u2026 trampled flowers\u2026 signs of a recent struggle.\n\nBounding through the garden followed by two scary looking dogs is a gardener, wielding a pitchfork, \u201cGET OUT! I\u2019LL SIC MY DOGS ON YA! NO MORE OF YOU COME IN!\u201d but the party quickly defuses the situation, pointing to their insignias and saying they have been sent help. He calls off the dogs and seems relieved to not have to make his last stand. He points to one of the backdoors \u201cIn there\u201d as he retreats to the stables.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=2790b5db-0981-4803-9fa3-29ec93acef6f)\n\nThe party makes their way inside, finding a grisly scene - a dormitory of humans have been completely slaughtered, hundreds of frenetic stab wounds, no survivors. They ready themselves for battle and enter\u2026. a dark laundry room and pantry. Another door beyond leads into a grand foyer with the furniture all thrown around.\n\nSeveral cultists of Sarenrae, covered in blood, stand in the center of the room. The party hears more fighting in the floor above. The cultists draw their knives, but Bahruhn & Rado appeal to Sarenrae \u201cmy brothers, we are here to help.\u201d With the help of a little [Charm](/doc/charm-person-UxSYwJXpea), they convince them they are fellow sun worshipers here to take part in the slaughter [Mother Yara](/doc/mother-yara-dawnbringer-4dR2aoAXG6). The cultists say they are here to find and free [Mother Yara](/doc/mother-yara-dawnbringer-4dR2aoAXG6)\n\nWhile these discussion are ongoing, Greyson asks one for \u201ca little help here in the pantry\u201d and takes him aside to feed his vampiric thirst where no one can see.\n\n# Talindra\n\nThe party, backed by the cultists, run up the stairs towards the sounds of fighting. Ramoth immediately recognizes the trio of terrorists - the gnome, the dark druid, and the man in the [leather jacket](/doc/jorek-zwTvrSOGgc). They all seem to be protecting an older woman, who has her back to the wall - the mistress [Talia Talindra](/doc/talia-talindra-u3RJTStFtn) being attacked in her own home. In the chaos and crowded room, Ama takes out Jorek, Rado summons his shadow, and Greyson stabs one of the cultists. All hell breaks loose, everyone begins to throw blows at those closest to them. The members of House Talindra begin to get desperate, realizing they are outnumbered and cornered. The gnomish wizard makes a mad dash across the room - avoiding all 3 opportunity attacks - and opens a portal, pushing Talia Talindra into it and escaping.\n\nThe party looks around at the wreckage of the room, soaked in blood and the bodies of the dead cultists. They begin ransacking the upper rooms. Rado flings open one door and discovers an arcane sigil painted on the floor\u2026 one he recognizes as a conjuration circle. Greyson opens up a bedroom and finds a small human child, the only surviving person in this place.\n\nThey talk to him and learn his name is Zartan, and that his parents sent him to Duskmire \u201cbecause they said they\u2019d take good care of me\u201d after they had to flee Saltmarsh after the attack. The party leads him outside, Rado tossing his fire magic on the house as they leave to burn the evidence.\n\nWith the sound of sirens rising in the distance and smoke billowing from the house, Greyson hands the kid a [Gold Scale Co.](/doc/gold-scale-company-m1WdlmIYwP) card and the party jumps down a manhole into the sewers below.",

We use it track our homebrew world lore and log what happens in each game session. *You* yourself can create any article or note you\u2019d like, or can improve the ones here. \n\n==Please do== :blush:\n\nNotable features of Outline you might be interested in:\n\n## Integrations\n\nOutline integrates with and supports embedding [lots and lots of types of content](https://www.getoutline.com/integrations) from other services. Mostly, you can just copy and paste a URL from somewhere like Youtube or Google Drive and it will embed.\n\nOf particular interest for tracking D&D related things:\n\n* [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com) - charts, diagrams, timelines, etc.\n* [Mindmeister](https://www.mindmeister.com/) - mind / relationship mapping\n* [Diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) - draw any kind of diagram\n  * We have a private mirror at <https://draw.dungeon.church>\n\n[See this page on the Outline website](https://www.getoutline.com/integrations) to see a full list of supported embedded services and any support information if you find yourself having trouble.\n\n## Markdown Support\n\nThe pages in Outline are stored as plaintext with it\u2019s formatting in simple Markdown. Discord and lots of other stuff also uses Markdown.\n\n* [Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) - learn Markdown in a few minutes\n* [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)\n* [Outline\u2019s Markdown support](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/outline/) - detailed status of what Markdown features are supported\n* [Discord Markdown guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-)\n* [Reddit\u2019s Markdown guide](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/markdown)\n\n#### D&D Tools\n\n* [Homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/) - This tool uses Markdown to generate PDF handouts that look exactly like WotC books. So you can copy and paste articles from the wiki to Homebrewery as an easy way to generate a nice PDF or print out.\n  * We have a private mirror at [https://homebrew.dungeon.church](https://homebrew.dungeon.church/), however this is currently experimental. Save your work locally if you use it!\n* [~~NPC Generator~~](http://miniworlds.online/generators/generateNPC.html) ~~- There are a lot of NPC generators but this might be the best one. Incredibly detailed, outputs as Markdown, and works on mobile browsers~~ ==appears to be down 9/7/24== :cry:\n\n## Templates\n\nThe wiki supports templates, which are sort of like a form you can create to make new articles in the wiki with the same formatting. This is useful for repetitive things like spells, monsters, NPC statblocks, etc. Access templates in the bottom left, below the collections.\n\n ![Making one of these things? Use a template](/api/attachments.redirect?id=eac1cc68-089c-42a4-ab54-798f688ab92b \" =382x361\")Templates can also be accessed in the top right of the article editor when you first open a blank article.",

The lizardfolk are milling about a series of smoldering barricades. The party is soon greeted by [Commodore Daniel Warrington](/doc/commodore-daniel-warrington-OHzOMkhMHS) and his [Iron Rider](/doc/iron-riders-of-abraxas-P77pTaxjou) [knights](/doc/iron-rider-knight-JIpk2Tegm7). He seems a little under the weather, but assures them they will receive the gold reward if they can get traffic flowing again. After commenting, \u201cAt least they didn\u2019t send a witch this time\u201d he offers the party jobs if they are successful.\n\n# Barricades\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=5fb37a73-74f7-4188-be11-ae0dfc767df5 \"right-50 =224x224\")Hydrax takes the lead with Sten, the two least human among the group and approach the lizardfolk soldier who orders them to halt and state their business. The lizardfolk tell them they have been displaced by \u201cundead tide\u201d [sahuagin](/doc/sahuagin-MkRLEKcGhh), and so have taken shelter in the unused fort. They will not allow any allies or associates of the sahuagin, and their orders currently include all human traffic in that.\n\nThe party explains they are here to help negotiate the problem, and the lizard folk say, \u201cWell yeah a lot of delegations have come through to speak to [the Queen](/doc/queen-othokent-cMhhHGTExV). But they all had gifts and stuff.\u201d The party also learns the Queen doesn\u2019t like surprises. After some goading by the lizardfolk they do a \u201cgift of service\u201d by going and tracking down their crocodile friend who \u201cisn\u2019t himself lately\u201d. Also, the password is `TICKLECORN`\n\n# Crocodile\n\nCrocodile turns out to be a [werecrocodile](/doc/werecrocodile-M6J5SCfBQB), which Folwin entices out of the water by cooking a little steak picnic by this fetid swamp. The crocodile emerges and chows down on Belladonna\u2019s leg, but Hydrax gets it in a grapple and the party rains down lots of non-lethal blows, attempting to not kill it in the process of subduing it. But it soon becomes clear on closer investigation that this creature is undead, and as it is overwhelmed it cries out, \u201cJust end it, I want real death\u201d as Belladonna\u2019s brown bear form finishes him off.\n\nSearching through the werecreature\u2019s things, they find a [Potion of Undeath](/doc/potion-of-undeath-RkXumhgmhW) and a [draconic longsword](/doc/longsword-of-the-dragon-empire-WNp5oBATI3).\n\n# Sunken Fort\n\nThey approach the old fort carefully, finding many tracks of lizardfolk and other humanoids. Belladonna has trouble getting in through the door, but Folwin has cooking oil.\n\nInside they find lizardfolk who demand a password the party provides. They descend into the lower level of the fort\u2026.\n\nDown the stairs they find lizardfolk shamans praying to [Proteus](/doc/proteus-Apiz4CreFn), beseeching him to lock away the undead once again. Hydrax lays some incense and engages them with theological discourse, while the others poke around the surrounding rooms.\n\nTo the north is a locked door marked with something they can\u2019t read, so they proceed south. In a western chamber, they encounter a wizard\u2019s work bench, which becomes animated. The others open some chests and out fly animated knives. It becomes clear a wizard named [Keledek](/doc/keledek-the-wizard-jGCH5H0n7q) was recently here, and he had been writing about having lost his material form but had succeeded in cleaving his soul to a new corporeal form. This is a bit over Belladonna\u2019s head, but Folwin recognizes the arcane diagrams and notes, being disembodied himself. He knows that what this wizard speaks of is forbidden.\n\n# Negotiations\n\n ![Golpa Gorman, traveling merchant](/api/attachments.redirect?id=fe581396-8bb5-4c47-8e8e-3a7ac9027624)\n\nThe party finds a frogfolk merchant named [Golpa Gorman](/doc/golpa-gorman-XJoFieX3bk) taking a relaxing hot spring bath in one sunken chamber. They learn that many delegations have come through to meet the queen, he has no opinion, but the mermaids were quite jerks about the whole affair (and they tried to charm him into some deals! even though he already offers great deals!). The party does some excellent trades with him and he wishes them good luck (ribbit).\n\nThrough the sunken tunnels they find a mermaid King [Ukeo](/doc/ukeo-LL5CtPF7RQ) attended by his servants, who are indeed kinda jerks who go on and on about how the lizardfolk really need *them* the aquatic people who have to really coexist with the sahuagin. On the way out, the party manages to distract and pickpocket the king, getting some excellent Helm of Underwater Action loot.\n\n ![French accent jerks](/api/attachments.redirect?id=4906629b-e4b1-4171-9d78-dbe572651889)\n\n# Audience with the Queen\n\nThe party continues and finds armored lizardfolk guards at the threshold of the Queen\u2019s court. They again advise the party that the Queen does not like surprises, and that they should present an appropriate gift. They are amazed when the party shows them the Draconic longsword, an \u201cartifact of their ancestors\u201d.\n\nAfter some huddling on the best course of action, Hydrax tells everyone to hang back and act like his servants or entourage, and he approaches as the dragonborn before the lizardfolk court. Zazok the priest stops him, and asks why should they talk with townsfolk and Iron Riders who are in alliance with the sahuagin? Don\u2019t the humans collude with the sahuagin to control boats in the harbor? This comes as news to the party, and they tell him they are definitely against the undead and didn\u2019t know what the Iron Riders were up to. Their genuine outrage quells Zazok\u2019s anger, and the party makes their case before the [Queen Othokent](/doc/queen-othokent-Lh01gZxJrB).\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=9148b209-6422-4553-9143-c9446d94cc49)\n\nHydrax says the road should be opened to all, but that if the Iron Riders are in cahoots with the sahuagin, they will help the lizardfolk prove it to the townsfolk. No payment needed.\n\nJust as they are coming to an agreement, alarm bells begin to go off. Zazok yells out, \u201cIf you are truly our allies, help us! The sahuagin approach the fort!\u201d\n\nThe party battles it out through water vortex to defeat the invaders, who cry out \u201cwe\u2019ll be back!!\u201d as their own blood is spilled into the swamp. Folwin levitates to get the upper hand, and Belladonna\u2019s [Moonbeam](/doc/moonbeam-2tycGUS2Ys) dissolves sahuagin into oblivion. The swamp finally becomes quiet again except for the droning of mosquitos.",

      "content": "## [Character Sheet](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/138201525)\n\nHuman - Ranger - Sage \n\nVermin Lord (Grimhallow)\n\n## **Part One: Into the Caves**\n\nMable grew up among the trees in the Dreadwood. She first connected with the small animals around her home at the age of 3, when she made good friends with a black squirrel she fondly named **Squirrelle**. As a child she explored the caves and temple ruins around her home, venturing deeper and deeper into the caves, discovering their secrets. \n\nAt the age of 12, she ventured deeper than she ever had before, and that is when disaster struck. While scrambling down a narrow cavern wall she misplaced her foot and tumbled deep down into a shaft, landing upside down, wedged between the walls. There she hung for three long days, blood pooling in her brain, thirsty and in pain. Mable cried out for help but no one could hear her. \n\nShe thought this might be the end of her short life, when out of the darkness emerged a small group of rats. Eye to eye, upside down, the rats assessed her situation, sniffing at her as she plead for help. The largest rat suddenly began to vibrate, letting out a low hum that echoed throughout the caverns, summoning the rats from all corners of the caves. Like a tsunami, a wave of rats flooded the space pushing on Mable\u2019s back, in a flurry of fur they set about unwedging her from her position and sitting her upright, returning her small ruck sack and lifting her back to the top of wall from which she had fallen. And just as quickly as they came, the rats rushed away into the cracks of the cave vanishing into the darkness. All but the large rat who sat calmly at Mables side while she recovered from her long stint of upsidedownedness. Mable retrieved her waterskin and a ration from her rucksack, and offered the generous half of her ration to the rat. \n\nMable had always felt a connection to the creatures of the forest, but she never anticipated such an intimate bond with the vermin that lived in the dark, forgotten places of the world. The large rat, a creature larger than any she had seen, did not skitter away when she offered the half-ration of dried fruit. Instead, it slowly approached, its amber eyes glowing faintly in the shadows. It took the offering delicately with its sharp claws, as though it understood the gesture for what it was\u2014an exchange, an acknowledgment.\n\nMable smiled faintly, her body still trembling from the ordeal. The rat\u2019s whiskers twitched in the dim light, and for a moment, she felt a strange sensation wash over her, as though the rat was communicating with her without words, its thoughts brushing against hers like a passing breeze.\n\nThe rat scurried to her side, and though it did not speak, it made a series of low, vibrating hums that resonated in the air. She could feel it in her bones, a vibration that seemed to harmonize with the very pulse of the earth. It was then that Mable realized\u2014this wasn\u2019t just a rat. This creature was something more, something ancient. Its presence filled her mind with images\u2014dark tunnels, endless stone corridors, and shadows moving in unison, all connected by some unseen thread.\n\nThe vibrations of the rat grew louder, and the world around her seemed to shift. Her senses sharpened, and she could feel the skittering of tiny paws in the walls and the cracks of the cavern, the stirrings of countless rats hidden just out of sight. She wasn\u2019t just *hearing* the rats. She was *feeling* them. The pulse of their movement, the thrum of their collective energy. She was no longer just a girl in the caves; she was part of something much larger.\n\nThe rat, as though sensing her confusion, chirped softly and padded away. It paused at the edge of the cavern, then turned back to face her, its eyes glowing brighter now. There was a silent invitation in its gaze, a beckoning that seemed to pull at her very core.\n\nWith a soft breath, Mable stood. The moment she did, the rats that had flooded the cave earlier returned, emerging from every crack and crevice in the stone. They gathered around her in a sea of wriggling fur and twitching noses, as if awaiting her command. The ground seemed to vibrate beneath her feet, the rats moving in rhythm with her heartbeat.\n\nShe could feel them now\u2014not just as creatures, but as allies. Their presence no longer terrified her. She understood them, and in turn, they understood her.\n\nThe large rat came to her side again, its glowing eyes filled with a strange recognition. It had been the one to lead her here, and now, it seemed, it was time to offer her the power of the caves, the power of the rats.\n\n\"You saved me,\" Mable whispered, her voice thick with awe. \"But why? What do you want from me?\"\n\nThe rat\u2019s answer was simple\u2014a soft hum, and a surge of energy that seemed to flow into her veins. It was as though the rat had connected her to something ancient, something primal. The rats weren\u2019t just animals\u2014they were creatures of the deep, bound to the dark underworld, and in her, they had found something to guide them.\n\nThe rat scurried to her feet and sat, watching her as though waiting for her to make a decision. She could feel the bond between them growing, stretching out like a thread woven between her soul and theirs.\n\nAnd then it clicked.\n\n\"I\u2026 I can summon you,\" she said softly, more to herself than anyone else. \"I can summon all of you.\"\n\nThe large rat let out a low, approving hum, and the others scurried in response, their tiny bodies swarming around her. Mable reached out instinctively, and with a deep, grounding breath, she focused on the rats, their energy flowing through her. She could sense every rat in the cave now, every creature beneath the earth, every little movement. The rats that had once been nothing but pests now seemed to be an extension of herself.\n\nWhen Mable closed her eyes and concentrated, the ground seemed to ripple. Rats poured from the walls and crevices, flooding the cavern in a wave. They followed her every command, moved in harmony, as if they had always been hers to control.\n\nShe realized that this was her gift. Her connection to the rats was no accident. It was her destiny. The rats had chosen her, and through them, she had become something more\u2014a Vermin Lord, a master of the dark places, the tunnels, and the forgotten spaces beneath the earth.\n\nFrom that moment on, Mable was no longer just a girl from the Dreadwood. She was the one they called when the rats came. She was their queen in the shadows, their guide through the deep. And with each passing year, the power grew stronger within her.\n\nNo longer would Mable be a frightened child who wandered too far into the caves. Now, she was a force, one that could summon the darkness and bend it to her will. The rats, once seen as vermin, were now her most loyal servants, her eyes and ears in every corner of the world. And whenever she needed them, they would come, swarming from the depths to answer her call.\n\nAs she left the cave behind, walking back into the twilight of the Dreadwood, she felt the pulse of her power, the weight of her new title. She was Mable, the Vermin Lord, and the rats would always be with her.\n\n### Part 2: The Monastery of the Sacred Rat\n\nMable\u2019s life had shifted as dramatically as the world around her. The girl who once wandered the caves of the Dreadwood, befriended by squirrels and saved by rats, had become the Vermin Lord, and with her power came a sense of purpose. She used her growing influence not just to summon rats, but to forge a new path for them in the world\u2014one where vermin were no longer regarded as pests or nuisances, but revered as equals to humanoids.\n\nWith the passage of years, Mable\u2019s village, once a quiet cluster of humble homes at the edge of the Dreadwood, had grown. As word spread of her abilities and vision, a small but devoted following of like-minded individuals gathered around her. Some were villagers who had long respected the creatures of the forest; others were outcasts, wanderers, or those who had heard whispers of Mable\u2019s power and sought to be part of something greater.\n\nTogether, they established the **Monastery of the Sacred Rat**, an order devoted to the worship and protection of vermin\u2014rats, mice, bats, and all the creatures that scuttled unseen in the shadows of the world. The monastery, nestled in a secluded grove near the Dreadwood\u2019s edge, was a place of peace and contemplation, but also a gathering point for action. Its mission was clear: to elevate the status of vermin, to protect them from the encroaching threats of civilization, and to teach the world that these creatures were not to be feared, but understood.\n\nThe order's teachings were simple. Vermin, like humans and other intelligent beings, had a place in the world. They were not just survivors of the dark but stewards of balance in nature\u2019s grand design. To that end, Mable and her followers sought to spread their philosophy far and wide, forging alliances with other creatures of the Dreadwood, from the fey folk to the more enigmatic woodland beings.\n\nOver time, the Monastery's influence grew. The Dreadwood was a vast and untamed forest, and its denizens were not easily swayed, but Mable\u2019s message resonated with many. The monks of the monastery\u2014called the **Squeak Brotherhood**\u2014were known for their courage, their wisdom, and above all, their ability to move unnoticed through the wilderness, communicating with vermin and fostering peaceful relations with even the most reclusive creatures. The rats were their greatest allies, and it was said that Mable could summon entire swarms at will, directing them with the same ease that a shepherd guides a flock.\n\nYet, despite their growing influence, there were still many who dismissed the Monastery as a group of eccentrics or worse\u2014cultists who had fallen under the sway of dangerous magic. Some even feared the power Mable had acquired, convinced that her control over rats was a harbinger of some greater dark force. Mable, however, was undeterred. She had a higher calling: to protect all creatures of the shadows, not just vermin, and to show the world that there was power in humility, in the quiet, unnoticed corners of life.\n\n### The Discovery of Delirium\n\nOne day, deep in the caverns beneath the Dreadwood, a rat monk named **Whiskerfinn**, who had spent years exploring the subterranean realms, uncovered something extraordinary: a vein of **Delirium**. The glowing shards of crystal were unlike anything seen before. They pulsed with an eerie, otherworldly light, and a strange hum resonated from them, not unlike the vibrations Mable had first felt when she encountered the great rat so many years ago.\n\nDelirium was a dangerous and powerful substance\u2014magic gone awry after the catastrophic **Incident**, a disaster that had shaken the very foundations of the land. The Incident had unleashed waves of chaotic, unpredictable magic upon the world, and since then, the land around the old dwarven city of **New Galmaarden** had been scarred with eldritch corruption. But the discovery of Delirium in the Dreadwood was something new. It was magic on a scale not seen before, a force that had the potential to reshape the world\u2014or destroy it.\n\nThe monks of the monastery were divided. Some, like **Brother Nibblestone**, saw the Delirium as a blessing. \"This could be the key to unlocking even greater power for our order,\" he argued. \"With this, we could elevate the rats and all vermin to a higher plane of existence. We could show the world that we are not mere animals, but beings of incredible power and potential.\"\n\nOthers, like **Sister Arfina**, were more cautious. \"Delirium is unstable. We don\u2019t know what it can do to those who come into contact with it. We should leave it alone, before it corrupts us all.\" She spoke with the weight of experience\u2014her own people had encountered similar magic during the early days of the Monastery, and they knew how dangerous such power could be.\n\nMable, now in her late forties, stood at the heart of the debate, torn between her loyalty to the order and her understanding of the risks involved. She had always believed that the rats, and by extension, all vermin, had a place in the world\u2014one that was not to be feared, but respected. But Delirium? It was different. It was potent magic that she could barely comprehend.\n\nThe order, in their wisdom, decided to send Mable on a quest\u2014a dangerous journey to the heart of **New Galmaarden**, the city that had been abandoned by the dwarves centuries ago. The city, now a shattered and chaotic place, was still the source of much ancient magic, and it was there that they hoped to find more information about the Delirium.\n\n### **A Choice**\n\nAs Mable set out for New Galmaarden, she knew the journey would be perilous. The city was a wild, ungovernable place, where danger lurked around every corner. But Mable also knew that the Delirium was no ordinary magic. It was tied to the chaos of The Incident, and its power could either save or damn them all.\n\nAnd somewhere in the depths of the ruined city, buried beneath the rubble and the madness, lay the key to the Monastery\u2019s future\u2014and perhaps the fate of all those who walked in the shadows. Would Mable return with a weapon to help her people, or would she find that some forces were simply too dangerous to tame?\n\nThe rats were calling, as they always had, but this time, the call was darker. This time, it was not just for protection\u2014it was for something greater. And Mable, the Vermin Lord, had to decide whether she was ready to answer it.\n\n\\\n**Personality traits:** \n\n### **Ideals:**\n\n### Power. Knowledge is the path to power and domination.

Battered with contamination and the effects of the shadow drains, they invent a new bird before attempting to find a place to rest in an old home that looks mostly intact, just boarded up. Inside they discover an eldritch salt circle, which when interrupted, angers a [ghost](/doc/poltergeist-UdVS1rLmud) and lets in a delirium contaminated monster. They fight their way back and travel a few blocks to the promenade along the eastern side of the River Drann. Where before they had traveled over a bridge, they see it has collapsed and been replaced by the web of several giant phase spiders. They concoct a plan that mostly works: Craggy distracts with a Major Image, the others light the web and hurl their attacks, and Hydrax makes a run for it and Jumps to a boat on the opposite side. With the spiders defeated, they float towards home\u2026\n\n# Scribe\u2019s Recap\n\nThe party (Quavence, Craggy, Hydrax, Harrowhark, and their hostage [Rorsh](/doc/rorsh-the-mage-umxTjXQj7k)) barely escaped [Galmaarden](/doc/new-galmaarden-03tcpxxc2t), still reeling from strength drains, heavy contamination (Quavence looking especially rotten), and a series of rough ambushes by both dogfolk and a massive executioner construct. Reunited outside the city, they roasted the legendary **Timothy\u2019s One-Eyed Disembodied Purple-Breasted Warbler** for breakfast, discovered and exploited a hidden salt circle that repelled a contaminated ooze monster, and handed Hydrax the magical Wand of Magic Missiles and a dwarven sailor\u2019s ring (for prestidigitation). After defeating the ooze, looting a wizard\u2019s wand from Rorsch\u2019s pants, and collecting some disgusting goo samples, they navigated a ruined bridge blocked by massive spider webs. Craggy\u2019s illusion of a giant flaming warbler, Hydrax\u2019s heroic dragon-jump, and some reckless web-burning got the whole party (and a barely-alive, soggy Rorsch) onto a drifting boat, setting them on course (unknowingly) back to Emberwood. The session ends with the party battered, slimed, slightly more magical, and adrift, planning their return\u2014and already arguing about the next bad idea.\n\n## Key Points\n\n\n 1. We reunited with Harrowhark and Hydrax outside the city walls after escaping through the secret tunnel under the [Black Ivory Inn](/doc/black-ivory-tavern-dwK4zxrboT).\n 2. Quavence is at contamination level 3 with visible rotting; Craggy is at contamination level 1.,\n 3. Rorsh (wizard hostage) survived, is still bound and gagged, and had a hidden wand of magic missiles strapped to his leg.\n 4. We have coded research papers from the mission, which Harrowhark intends to examine later.,\n 5. Harrowhark used comprehend languages on the coded research papers and learned the distillation process for eldritch lilies (written in infernal), but the transformation process remains undecipherable.\n 6. Hydrax discovered a salt circle with an arcane symbol under a couch, but disturbed it before Harrowhark could examine it; the symbol's details are now lost.,\n 7. We were ambushed in the safe house by a dwarven specter and a giant contaminated sludge that blocked the only exit.,\n 8. The contaminated sludge can engulf and restrain targets, inflicting contamination and heavy damage each turn; being engulfed causes a DC 15 CON save and 8d6 damage per turn.,\n 9. The sludge is repelled and harmed by salt; Hydrax threw salt at it, causing it to recoil and eventually flee, allowing us to trap it with a salt circle and finish it off.,\n10. Physical attacks with magic weapons (Craggy's delirium dagger) were effective in destroying the sludge.,\n11. We found a magical ring (dwarven sailor's ring of prestidigitation) in the remains of the sludge, which Hydrax received as a reward for discovering the salt weakness.,\n12. Craggy recognized the ring as similar to one worn by [Sjostein](/doc/sjostein-saltwhisperer-MDEMFcPuhW), a mentor from the [Salt Whisper Trading Company](/doc/saltwhispers-trading-company-NYN8gvys1m), and recalled that such rings were common among dwarven sailors during the migration.,\n13. Craggy recalled Sjostein's advice: \"Never trust anybody that you can't have a beer with,\" and noted the suspicious prohibition on alcohol among the [Falling Fire cult](/doc/followers-of-the-falling-fire-6l87uOJncb).,\n14. The bridge over the Dran River was destroyed and covered in giant spider webs, with a giant spider and smaller spiders present; the river below is contaminated and dangerous to enter.,\n15. Hydrax used the ring of jumping to leap toward a boat but fell into the contaminated water, gaining another level of contamination, then managed to board the boat and set it adrift.\n16. The giant spider leapt onto the boat and attacked Hydrax, knocking him unconscious, but Harrowhark revived him and Hydrax finished the spider with the wand of magic missiles. Rorsh (the hostage) attempted to escape by jumping into the river and began drifting downstream, out of reach; the party is now on the boat, drifting down the Dran River toward Emberwood Village, with Rorsh possibly lost.\n\n## Fun Moments\n\n* Craggy: When the group debated the right to privacy for their prisoner, Craggy declared, \"There are no right to privacy in Galmaarden,\" as Hydrax added, \"He's a prisoner. He has no privacy.\",\n* Hydrax: Hydrax, proud new owner of a wand, boasted, \"You know, that's why my hand was in his pants, guys. You know what I get?\" after discovering the hidden magic item on their hostage.,\n* Harrowhark: Taking a blood sample from a seriously contaminated Quavence, Harrowhark warned, \"Any... worsening of this condition, and I think we would have had a auto amputating facial feature situation,\" then teased, \"you really need your nose intact.\",\n* Group (Craggy, GM, and all): In a riotous session of naming fantasy birds, the group collaboratively created \"Timothy's one eyed purple breasted disembodied warbler,\" to which Hydrax added ominously, \"there are stories of, those birds stealing, like, kidnapping children, eating them in the forest.\",\n* Hydrax: Facing a goo monster, Hydrax took an unconventional\u2014and gross\u2014approach: \"I'm gonna try and eat it and see...if that at least damages it.\" Later, he helpfully reviewed, \"It tastes like boogers. Okay. I'm gonna go.\"\n\n\\\n",

      "content": "## Overview\n\nA modest coastal trade town on the north eastern side of the isolated island of @[W\u00e6rlessh\u00e6th](mention://fcd8e8c0-dc47-4da7-a2b1-67853a2915a8/document/111310df-f8be-4ae8-b881-1a621256311e). Famous for it\u2019s main export of various locally produced brews \u2014 most notably the unique dwarven grog, Greta\u2019s Grace. \n\n## History\n\n### The Discovery\n\nA few decades before the Incident in Galmaarden, two dwarven half-brothers of the names [Sjostein Saltwhisperer](/doc/sjostein-saltwhisperer-MDEMFcPuhW) and Cruckseric \u201cCrux\u201d [Groggut](/doc/groggut-family-FghGxgUfrm) stumbled upon an arch in the limestone walls of the island of W\u00e6rlessh\u00e6th\u2019s towering coastline. This discovery was made while the dwarves, who happened to be heavily involved in the illicit rum smuggling trade, were navigating between the karst pillars and chaotic currents surrounding the island as they attempted to flee amongst the fog from crown authority ships. Seeing the hole in the limestone as a chance to evade their pursuers, the brothers took the risk of navigating their humble cutter ship \u2014 the Ap\u00e9ritif \u2014 within the waters flowing under the arch to find a bay with crystalline blue waters hugged by a beach of unusually colorful sands waiting for them on the other side.\\n\\nAfter successfully evading the navy and beaching their vessel, the two dwarves buried a bottle of their finest rum promising to share it the day a permanent port would be established by them as a land of new opportunity.  Crux, feeling relieved after facing the uncertainty of sailing under the arch, decided to name the land bridge Greta\u2019s Grace, after his lover who remained in Galmaarden during this time. The two dwarves setup camp on the beach of red, black, and white colored sand where they found geothermal pools to rest in and watched the bay glow magical colors the likes their eyes had never seen before as night fell upon the island. The named the beach the Hearthstone Strands and the bay the Prismatic Cove respectfully.\\n\\nThough before the Incident, this discovery came during a turbulent time in [Galmaarden\u2019s](/doc/new-galmaarden-03tcpxxc2t) history where many individuals were seeking economic and personal freedom far from the crown authorities rule which some deemed at the time as overbearing and unjust. To establish a port without further harassment from the crown, the smugglers ventured to obtain an officially sealed charter from Galmaarden, which served to be quite difficult given their less than squeaky clean criminal records. Knowing this, the two dwarves hatched a plan to obtain an unsigned charter from a well established merchant-brewer house in Galmaarden, the [Velvetbelly](/doc/the-violet-hour-libations-parlour-via-house-velvetbelly-4uGPTklChT) family.\\n\n\n### The Settlement\n\nThrough some questionably legal acts, depending upon the lawyers you ask, a notarized and recognized charter was obtained. Upon this achievement, Crux and Greta sailed to their new island on the *Aperitif* while being guided by his brothers newly obtained, much larger jackass brig, *Fortune\u2019s Folly*, captained by [Sjostein](/doc/sjostein-saltwhisperer-MDEMFcPuhW) himself. On arriving back on the island, the Grogguts built their first home and distillery from the planks of the Aperitif. A few months later, the son of Greta and Crux, [Craggylheim \u201cCraggy\u201d Groggut](/doc/craggylheim-groggut-zF0JwTQJsP), would be the first dwarf born on the island. Given the calm weather within the bay compared to the rest of the coast, the Grogguts decided to name the new settlement [Str\u00fcmfreih\u00e5fen](/doc/sturmfreihafen-strumfreihafen-9imRbQ02Fq) \u2014 meaning \u201cStorm Free Haven\u201d in the traditional Dwarven tongue.\\n\\nCraggy would be born under an unusually rare astronomical event, a lunar eclipse occurring as a blue moon during the last month of the year. He would be named after the range of volcanic plumes that divided the island in two. The next day, rainbow colored shining cicadas would leave hibernation and fill the island for a year.\\n\\n[Sjostein](/doc/sjostein-saltwhisperer-MDEMFcPuhW) would remain a dwarf of the seas, but in the following years he would take up business shuttling families \u2014 who bought land claims from Crux seeking to immigrate to the island and settle permanently for a new life with the cove\u2019s mild weather, idyllic coastal lifestyle, and newfound freedoms unrestrained by crown authority \u2014 across the seas to their new home. Many of these families were [gnomes](/doc/gnome-rock-ARFvDASnZz) and goblinoids seeking lands of opportunity without oppression from the Dwarven crown. On the island, the side settled by the Groggut family appeared to be mostly clear of jungles and instead was composed of a flat plateau which led to a range of thirteen volcanic crags. Wells were dug on the plateau, leading to the discovery of freshwater which given some Dwarven and gnomish engineering led to the irrigation for new farms on the island. \\n\\nThe dwarves initially found the surrounding land too arid to work, but quickly found through the assistance of various settlers who followed that deep aquifers below the plateau held the secret to irrigating the volcanic soils, making it ideal for growing sugar beets, hops, apples, and more. Crux, being a former boatswain, took joy in climbing the crags of the volcanic mountain range. He began crossing to the other side and would bring back exotic tropical fruits which he would use in blends of grog the family produced. Soon, [Strumfreihafen](/doc/sturmfreihafen-strumfreihafen-9imRbQ02Fq) became a main stop for skilled sailors due to the success of this first grog, which the family named Greta\u2019s Grace. The drink became popular due to its scurvy preventing properties and its exotic flavors as well as the tall tale marketing campaigns that Sjostein and his ragtag crew spread by word of mouth on his travels. \\n\\nOne day when venturing for fruit on the other side of the crags, Crux would not return. It is suspected he passed in a climbing accident during a storm that ravaged the island for one day short of a consecutive fortnight. The storm ended on Craggy\u2019s 13th birthday, and on the next day the cicadas filled the island once again.\n\n### The Coup\n\nEventually, the success of the Groggut\u2019s beverage, even after the disappearance of Crux, would draw the attention of house [Velvetbelly](/doc/the-violet-hour-libations-parlour-via-house-velvetbelly-4uGPTklChT). The primary heir of the family, Vincelliott Velvetbelly, would arrive on the island 25 years after Strumfreihafen\u2019s founding and claim that Cruckseric\u2019s and Greta\u2019s marriage had no legal basis, meaning that the Groggut distillery belonged to the house of Berggeist which owed house Velvetbelly years of unpaid debts. Vincelliott also showed a charter which displayed house Velvetbelly as the owners of the island of W\u00e6rlessh\u00e6th in the eyes of the crown. The heir of the Velvetbellies then used his private militia to enforce the seizure of local businesses and farms which he claimed their owners now belonged to their house as indentured servants due to contractual debts before he returned to Galmaarden leaving his cousins to manage the town. \\n\\nSjostein, hearing of this and believing the charter the Velvetbelly house possessed was forged, came back to Strumfreihafen to sneak Craggy by request of his mother. Greta stayed on the island to watch out of the community while paying debts the Velvetbelly family demanded paid in hopes to not escalate violence for the entire village, but Sjostein took Craggy in as the powder monkey of his crew with intention of sailing to Galmaarden and obtaining proof that the new Velvetbelly charter was fabricated. When searching in Galmaarden, on Craggy\u2019s 26th birthday, the Incident occurred.\n\n## Notable Places and People\n\nThere are no less than 4 major brewing families, with many minor brewhouses, that have shaped this enclave.\n\n* [Groggut Brewery](/doc/groggut-grog-house-Pa5fu0QRqI) \u2014 ran by the widow of the late Crux, Greta Groggut\n* [The Violet Hour Libations Parlour via House Velvetbelly](https://lore.dungeon.church/doc/the-violet-hour-libations-parlour-via-house-velvetbelly-4uGPTklChT) \u2014 owned by Vincelliott  Velvetbelly but managed by his cousins while he is away in Galmaarden\n* [3 Brothers Alehouse](/doc/three-brothers-ales-2Qdzsgf4An) \u2014 co-owned by Brannik, Brannuk, and Brannok a three-headed monster\n* [Pommepress Family Orchards and Cidery](/doc/pommepress-family-orchards-cidery-5cuIaCEs2o) \u2014 led by the father of the Pommepress house who goes by \u201cPop-Pop\u201d\n* the Motley Medley - a collectivist group of outcasts who run the local farm and provide the occasional homebrewed mead and paired a cappella quartet performance at the nearby Pommepress Cidery\n\n[pron-Sturmfreihfaen.mp3 68481](/api/attachments.redirect?id=7eed9e3d-e861-4cd4-ab3c-582840f0f205)\n\n## Map\n\n[https://www.dungeon.church/map/sturmfreihafen/](https://www.dungeon.church/map/sturmfreihafen/)\n\n\n---\n\n* [ProcGen Map Link](https://watabou.github.io/village-generator/?seed=1778683264&tags=no%20square%2Cgrove%2Ccrossroads%2Ccoast%2Corganic&name=Sturmfreihafen&pop=434&roads=201690)\n\n[sturmfreihafen style.json 1317](/api/attachments.redirect?id=8aae219e-b55f-4808-a9fa-e9b92e6a568f)\n\n\\\n\\\n",

She was born as an elfmarked person though. Unfortunately she never felt like she truly belonged within Striborg, due to it being a majority human city. As a result, Belladonna withdrew from interacting with other children to read books about the ancient elven heroes in the library. Concerned about their daughter, Belladonna\u2019s parents moved to [Saltmarsh](/doc/saltmarsh-GkGI6ISio5) to escape the bustle of city life and in hopes that Belladonna would have an easier time finding a community of other elfmarked children. \n\nAt Saltmarsh, Belladonna found other elfmarked children to play with. But as a result of feeling like an impostor in Striborg, she still had a tendency to head into the shallow parts of the [Dreadwoods](/doc/dreadwood-GcfKdBzGyT) by herself. Her time in Striborg trained her to become used to being alone, but that time also seemed to have caused her to be more neurotic compared to her peers. \n\nRight now, her long term goals are finding out more information about the disappearance of elves from Pyora. She has her sights set upon [Durandar](/doc/durandar-sWDxZHDVIC) since only the oldest dwarves were alive during the time when elves still existed\u2026 And if she can find any group of elves that still exists and is thriving, then maybe she could immerse herself in their community and find a sense of belonging among them. She already learned Elvish using the books she read in the libraries of Striborg and looks more like an elf anyway. ",

The blind old fucker? Apparently he cleaned up gambling on darts at the [mining camp](/doc/the-old-mine-ndIfgvk1B6). Another dwarf pops over and tells Caspian to shut up about work. He goes on a tirade against the owners of the [Dwarven Anvil](/doc/the-dwarven-anvil-1tj8fn0d9l), a blacksmith in town that\u2019s actually run by two humans. He says they sold him a load of bullshit about their artifacts being from the Old Times - more like stolen dwarven culture! He drunkenly proposes a little burglary. The party decides to exit this shit show and get some rest.\n\n# The Oweland Crypt\n\n  ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=2eb0ca8f-8284-4d1a-9101-23c6aca8dd90)\n\nThe party steps out onto the night street and sees a [familiar carriage](https://lore.dungeon.church/doc/session-7-stardust-Y1TgrrgS3t#h-friends-at-the-temple) going towards the outskirts of town - it\u2019s the lady [Oweland](/doc/eda-oweland-HEslJp2L08). They make their way through the night crowd of main street to the more quite area near the cemetery, where only a few torches burn along it\u2019s walls. The party holds back and watches as the carriage lets out a hooded figure at a mausoleum, who disappears into the interior. The carriage takes off, leaving the cemetery, and it\u2019s passenger behind.\n\nThe party creeps down the stairs, with Greyson in the lead. They enter a small antechamber with 3 doors. After much debate about which door to try first, they decide to go left.\n\nIn a large half-moon chamber, there sits a large statue of a heroic man wielding a sword, with a dragon skull under his boot. Mosaics line the upper walls of this room, showing dragons raining fire down on a city, boats fleeing, and portraits of warriors against a backdrop that looks like a lot like Saltmarsh.\n\nGreyson approaches the statue and clears the cobwebs from the plaque. It reads \u201c[Sir Thomas Oweland the Dragon Slayer](/doc/sir-thomas-oweland-the-dragon-slayer-A6kJDPu7SS) - presented as a gift to the Oweland Family Trust on behalf of the citizens of Saltmarsh\u201d\n\nSuddenly\u2026.they hear a whisper\u2026. \u201c*Please free me\u2026 I am trapped*\u201d the voice seems to be coming from within the statue.\n\nThe party is not sure what to do. They make several inquiries of the voice, how did it get trapped and how can it be freed? But the voice just implores them to \u201c*Help me\u2026*\u201d\n\nMath attempts to ask the questions again, but in draconic. This seems to greatly upset whatever spirit is here, as it roars and echoes the chamber with a cry out in a demonic tongue the party does not recognize. They decide they better leave this statue alone.\n\nAfter some investigation back in the antechamber, they decide the right doorway is a no go and continue onward deeper into the crypt. The door opens into a long, very dark hallway\u2026.\n\n### Lighting the Way\n\nGreyson readies his lantern, and Krack takes hold of it with her [Mage Hand](/doc/mage-hand-1nhwE5UUt3), and they send it down the dark hallway to see what awaits them. \n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=e72faa51-ec1d-4b22-8b52-952d4a7acb3a)\n\nAs soon as the lantern passes an alcove in the hallway, the lantern smashes to the ground spilling its oil and flickering out. Something has smashed it.\n\nKrack creeps ahead with her darkvision, and all she sees is\u2026.. stone statues.\n\nThey figure the statues are reacting to the light, so Math gets the brilliant idea to cast [Light](/doc/light-lhQCDEW6iD) on one of the statues.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=000329bf-0310-4d9c-9278-1558834e34c4)The statue comes to life, and immediately punches itself in the face, taking off it\u2019s own nose.\n\nThe light cast from this statue animates some of the others in the hall, but only briefly. The party gets in a few punches and Mind Slivers as the lit statue pounds it\u2019s chest into dust.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=c544e02e-ee61-4f65-9c87-3f36d0c761f6)\n\nThe hall falls into darkness, and no one lights any more lights, as they continue through the door and into the next room..\n\n### Shadow Key\n\nThe next chamber is a very large circular room, with an unlit brazier in the center. Opposite the door the party entered is another door, with the outline of a black key painted above it. The smell of smoke lingers in this room.\n\nKrack lights the brazier, sending shadows across the ceiling. Greyson of course tries to pick the lock, to no success. Math tries the Light trick again, casting it on the rogue\u2019s lockpicking kit, but all it illuminates is that this lock is not mechanical in nature. There\u2019s nothing to pick.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=7a3a1b2d-8d64-47a7-ab18-c76c231bb48b)\n\nKrack steps forward and uses prestidigitation to form a small, mirror image of the painted key. She holds it up to the light of the brazier\u2019s fire and casts a shadow of the key on the door. It suddenly clicks open!\n\n### Inner Chapel\n\nThe next room descends down further, with the ground becoming wet beneath the party\u2019s boots. They creep into an even larger chamber, held up by large columns, the entire circular perimeter of the room filled with stacked drawers of tombs. In the center of this chamber is what appears to be an even older, smaller chapel, the stones barely still standing. Within this ruined circle, the Lady [Eda Oweland](/doc/eda-oweland-HEslJp2L08) is praying at a candlelit altar\u2026.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=99f50600-4c15-4f5b-bbc5-8a284296b42a)\n\n> **And when I passed by you and saw you struggling in your own blood, I said to you in your blood, \u2018Live!\u2019 Yes, I said to you in your blood, \u2018Live!\u2019 I made you thrive like a plant in the field; and you grew, matured, and became very beautiful. You were formed, your hair grew, but you were naked and bare. \u201cWhen I passed by you again and looked upon you, so I spread My wing over you and covered your nakedness. Yes, I swore an oath to you and entered into a covenant with you, and you became Mine**\n>\n> (Ezekiel 16:6)\n\nShe is unaware of the party\u2019s presence, and they creep closer, sneaking in for a look at what\u2019s happening. \n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=4fb86125-8422-45e5-b995-c7031d13a18e)\n\nThe lady Oweland lights some incense, and the smoke swirls into the humid air, settling into the form of a man\u2019s face. \n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=3fcc4559-b5d6-4d75-b53c-b0020005e916)\n\nA voice struggles to cross the void to answer Eda\u2019s prayers:\n\n> Is the plan in place? Is the appointed time set? Have you prepared [my sons](/doc/sebastian-barnaby-oweland-c5f2wjsPvu)?\n\nEda answers, \u201cYes, my lord. The way is prepared.\u201d\n\n> Let it be so\n\nThe voice thunders out, and the face devolves into smoke. The room is left empty except for the flickering of candles.\n\nThe party looks at each other silently in the dark from their hiding places, having witnessed all this. They watch the lady Oweland pick up a candle, and make her way to the back of the chamber, where the light disappears. \n\nThe party gets the fuck out of there as fast as possible.\n\n# The Auction\n\nThe party retires at the [Temple of Selune](/doc/temple-of-selune-RRv57upndO) guest house again. In the morning they are awakened by the bells of the [Saltmarsh Public House](/doc/saltmarsh-public-house-0anLgJ8olH). They make their way out on the streets and see a large crowd assembled outside - it\u2019s time for the auction! People are poring over posted notices of things for sale, with the [Old House](/doc/alchemists-house-D0Oo2ziTIj) the main attraction. Herschel comes out the door and announces that the auction is about to begin.\n\nThe crowd files inside, and the [Saltmarsh Council](/doc/saltmarsh-council-8KxfpMfTQ0) comes out to oversee this fundraiser for the Feast of the [Seven Fishes](/doc/session-14-festivals-eve-VAcA8ZfizE) (as a very well rested Eda Oweland explains). \n\nUp for auction first is the jug of cream they previously saw unboxed from a crate at Winston\u2019s Store. A few people bid, and then a short man with a pencil moustache and mousey demeanour jumps on his chair and yells, \u201c20 grand!\u201d The room is astonished and breaks out into whispers. Eda asks who he is to make such a generous donation to their town\u2019s festival, and he answers \u201c[Alton Valcrist](/doc/alton-valcrist-0eGr2KEV0J)\u201d and walks out the door with a flourish.\n\nSeveral other items of interest are auctioned - an elemental gem, a bard\u2019s drum, and various other strange things.\n\nFinally the time comes for the big auction of the house. [Manistrad Copperlocks](/doc/manistrad-copperlocks-W9uyiYutrl) steps down off the platform and into the crowd, and makes the first bid. Many others are made until only two are left: Math and Manistrad.\n\nThey stare each other down, each bidding the other up until the sum of 8500 gold is reached. Manistrad is pissed, Math has won the auction, and the house is now the party\u2019s, under budget no less.\n\n# The Gold Scale Company\n\nThe party decides to register their presence here in Saltmarsh, and they tell Herschel they want to operate the [Gold Scale Company](/doc/gold-scale-company-m1WdlmIYwP) from the old House. He writes it in the town ledger, and the party departs for their new home, conspiring about what to do next.\n\nThe old house is as they remember it, except the stairway down to the basement has been sealed over. Ferrets still dart through the overgrown rose bushes, a chicken wanders the first floor. The rain begins to fall, and the party gathers inside.\n\nThey hear a loud explosion - louder than the thunder of the storm - and look out to see a cloud of smoke rising from the direction of the dwarf mine.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=42cdcdd4-9c99-4115-9685-3c84a3891ca6)\n\n\\\n\\\n",

In the dining hall is a new friend: Harrowhark, who is taking notes in their notebook, greets them good morning. As they discuss the murder, she offers to help them determine cause of death.\n\nThey make their rounds about the city, and come to the Caravan Court where they find a gnome yelling at [Aldor the Immense](/doc/aldor-the-immense-xzpcXjqD6D), complaining that \u201cthis town is infested with rats\u201d. After some discussion they learn that he spent the night at the [Ole Hendrix Farm](/doc/old-hendrix-farm-DNPKQvAKgi).\n\n [Henner](/doc/henner-QWV9W3YInL) the honest boy\u2019s house is across the lane, and he is eager to tell the party that he counted 462 rats last evening, all headed south. The party takes this as a ominous sign.\n\nThey make their way to the scene of the crime - One Eyed Mountain[ Brewhouse](/doc/molten-hop-brewhouse-CfxGmUVYNA). They find it much as they left it, albeit now with a worse smell and more flies in the air. Thrulrik and Harrowhark examine the body again, and Harrowhark using her tools determines that the man was ripped apart, then eaten post-humously. Thrulrik wraps the body best he can in a sheet, and they lower it down to the lower levels and place it in the brewmaster\u2019s delivery cart.\n\nDetermined to make sure he is given a proper burial, they make their way through the back alleys to the side door of the Temple of the Sacred Flame. Their, Flamekeeper Hannah greets and thanks them. She tells them that, \u201cKnight-Captain\u2019s crusade has a heavy cost\u2026\u201d she points to 6 fresh graves in the graveyard. \u201cHe is determined to restore the glory of his family.\u201d She blesses the party for their good deeds.\n\n# [Hendrix Farm](/doc/old-hendrix-farm-DNPKQvAKgi)\n\nNow sure that the clues they seek are at the farm, they make their way over there. This time they find a disturbing scene - blood splatter and signs of a struggle in one of the side rooms. Searching the property, they find a small room with a large hole in the ground. Deep down beneath the surface of the earth, they hear running water\u2026.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=62f09cab-222d-460f-97f4-8da9a8360378)\n\n\\\n# The Sewer\n\nThrulrik attempts to descend with a rope, but falls into the muck below. The others simply [Feather Fall](/doc/feather-fall-6GOvSouXLl) down gently with the help of Quavence.\n\nDown in the darkness, they step around the flowing fundament and come upon the body of a [Falling Fire](/doc/followers-of-the-falling-fire-6l87uOJncb) cultist beset upon by [giant rats](/doc/diseased-giant-rat-ie3aHmHneu), and [rats with lightly glowing brains](/doc/swarm-of-cranium-rats-C8soW8rXRX) exposed - some horrible mutation. They dispatch these terrible beasts, and find that the cultist has written something in blood on the wall beside his final resting place\u2026.. \n\n> ==\u201cBALTHASAR\u201d==\n\nWasn\u2019t that the name of cultist lost to drink at the [Black Ivory Inn](/doc/black-ivory-tavern-dwK4zxrboT)? Intersting.\n\nFurther into the sewers, they come upon a great room where waters pours of pipes into a circular holding tank with a fast flowing curtain. In the mist that the water churns up are purple clouds, slightly glowing\u2026.. delerium? This far out of the city? Not a good sign.\n\nThey creep through and see two @[Ratling](mention://ed0a25ee-4726-4c6f-8617-ecd0aa44c210/document/613e77dc-1223-4429-b38e-a14a66dbbe35) guards standing outside a doorway, talking amongst themselves and oblivious to the party, both wearing the familiar purple robes of the Falling Fire.. The party gets themselves into position, and then launches their attacks. First Craggy with an illusion to distract them, then the others with their ranged attacks as Quavence runs around to flank them. Harrowhark throws some Poison Needles. Just as the party is getting the upper hand, a great swarm of [rats wearing a crown](/doc/rat-king-8OMI1KZ9gh) and using a gnome\u2019s skin as their puppet form emerges from the room, summoning rat swarms that run towards the injured party. They finally slay the fell beast.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=eca96efa-1f81-4d26-acfa-546d4564b6be)\n\nInside his underground room, they find a large amount of empty beer bottles, bearing the symbol of the Molton Hop. It smells strongly of alcohol.\n\nFrom the corpse of the Rat King, they find a [Delerium Forged Dagger](/doc/delerium-forged-dagger-5OshXhJW5D) stuck into the gnome\u2019s chest. They pull it out and notice that the hilt has the name \u201c[NATHANIEL](/doc/nathaniel-flint-wZ99bEd1hD)\u201d engraved on it.\n\nFollowing the tunnel through the rock they come upon a ladder. Following it up to a trap door, they open it and emerge into the great hall of [Durradin\u2019s First and Last Chance](/doc/durradins-first-last-chance-tavern-NGdActufoR). A surly bartender raises a glass as if it to throw it at them but stops himself.\n\n\u201cAy, god dammit you gave me a fright. Thought you were another rat!\u201d",

Ramoth runs over to the body (wasn\u2019t it just a [sentinel](/doc/bloodless-sentinels-UAT4Khzzp1)?) at the epicenter and attempts to heal the dhampir, but his undead nature does not accept the gift and he takes his last breath.  They see he is wearing the symbol of an [eye](/doc/eye-of-duskmire-zVMHbvUlGR).\n\nBertrand & Belladonna run after the terrorists, who flee into a narrow alley and throw down ball bearings behind them. An epic fight ensues.\n\nThe man in the dark jacket runs straight up the wall, unleashing another devastating [fireball](/doc/fireball-aT1QnILXxQ) in his wake. The other assailant [polymorphs](/doc/polymorph-iBJQ6oBCEY) into a [griffon](/doc/griffon-HuzCZ1vn6p) and grabs the shorter and slower gnome, taking flight. Bertrand and Belladonna attempt to follow after, climbing up the walls after them. A rooftop melee ensues, the fleeing terrorist draws his rapier and turns toward Belladonna.\n\nBertrand comes under attack by the gnome, who has drawn his daggers as the griffon clutches him by the shoulders, doing flyby attacks. The griffon deposits the gnome on the opposite rooftop, where he looks out over the square below and begins his unholy incantation - the bodies of the dead, scattered around the square, begin to rise as zombies and attack the crowd and Ramoth. The gnome takes off running over the rooftops away from the chaos he\u2019s sown.\n\nBelladonna and the terrorist deal serious blows to each other, until finally the hooded man uses command to \u201cJUMP\u201d Belladonna steels herself and does so, but manages to hang on to the rooftop by her fingers. The man sees his chance and runs, jumping to the other rooftop.\n\nDown below Ramoth and Bertrand fight their way through the hordes of undead.\n\nAs the griffon comes flapping it\u2019s wings around to come in for another swipe, Belladonna casts [polymorph](/doc/polymorph-iBJQ6oBCEY) on the griffon, transforming it into a flightless sheep. It falls to the ground with a loud thud, and transforms back into the now injured druid.\n\nLimping away into the alley, the druid forms a giant [wind wall](/doc/wind-wall-12Kz93VVP4), blocking her pursuers as she vanishes into the alleys.\n\nThe party finishes off the undead. Sentinels begin to show up, cordoning off the crowd and beginning to take control of the scene.  *\u201cKEEP BACK, HUMANS, FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY\u201d*\n\n# A Safe Place\n\nNow heavily injured, the party decides to regroup before pursuing the terrorists further. They don the heavy iron brooches that all humans seem to wear here, and attempt to blend in. They realize that despite [Duskmire](/doc/duskmire-hJey19lfsu) being a major city, they have not seen a single inn. Strange. Where can they take refuge?\n\nThey decide to go back to [Grim Mold\u2019s](/doc/grim-mold-US6JMu5NLP) [shop](/doc/grim-molds-relics-Q0YvmvmjLp) and see if they can barter their way to a place to stay. Grim Mold greets them politely but warily, and he takes much interest in the few potions they share with him. He says, \u201cOf course you can stay my friends, you may use my storage room to rest.\u201d He escorts them into the back of the shop into a brick room with many crates and shelves stacked high with items. \u201cPlease make yourselves at home.\u201d and instructs them to ring a brass bell if they need anything in the night.\n\nThe party licks their wounds and discusses all they\u2019ve experienced. Where can they find safety here in the city? Who were the terrorists? What happened to the sentinel they saw them attack? How can they leave this outer circle, where the humans are penned in, and get to the other parts of the city?\n\nRamoth is convinced they should seek help in the fey district she saw when they entered the city.\n\nThey rest, and in the morning, discover the door is both locked and barricaded from the outside. They are not guests, but prisoners!\n\nThrough a small window, they see an alley outside. Belladonna [shapes the stone](/doc/stone-shape-Ni4NXltKR3) with her arcane magic, and forms an exit. They rush out into the grim early morning light, free. Ramoth destroys Grim Mold\u2019s shop with her breath attack. \n\n# The River\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=4788dd30-9bd4-4b88-91c5-992c8e8ab0f5 \" =1024x326\")They make their way back to the wide boulevard that follows the dark river that separates this part of the city from the decadent neighborhoods to the east. Again, they see this border is very heavily patrolled and guarded by sentinels. They come up with an elaborate scheme to make a magic raft and cloak their forms in mist so no one can see. However, they have the good sense to test the waters first.\n\nRamoth creates a splashing distraction, like a wounded animal, and something comes up to the surface of the black water and takes a bite at it. All they see are teeth. Something is in there.\n\nBelladonna uses her magic to improve the clarity of the water, peering into the depths. She sees a giant alligator, lazily circling in the water below. She uses Speak with Animals to ask him what he wants, \u201cFRESH MEAT!\u201d he answers \u201cThey only throw their undead into the waters - disgusting! I long for the feeling of something fighting back in my jaws! Blood in the water!\u201d They inquire if he will allow them to pass safely if they bring him some fresh food, and he agrees, smiling his alligator smile at them.",

To maintain his power T\u2019zeldarun had to prevent rule from passing from King Belgarath to his heirs, who hated and mistrusted T\u2019zeldarun for his unseemly influence over the king. T\u2019zeldarun spent his nights studying necromancy and kept the king alive for a rumored 173 years during which time T\u2019zeldarun became the absolute power behind the throne and a wave of violence, evil and greed spread over the once prosperous and peaceful land.\u00a0The king\u2019s skin turned a greenish tint and smelled of rotting flesh, but he continued to live and even bear children. The King\u2019s two twin children from this period when he was under T\u2019zeldarun\u2019s sway (and his magic), were born with almost purple tinted eyes and pale greenish flesh and jet black hair. To a one, they turned towards evil and chaotic pursuits during their lives. T'zeldarun wrote The Book of the Dead as a diary to record his discoveries in the arts of Necromancy.\n\n## Spell List\n\nMuch of the book is written in arcane symbols and code.\n\n* [Chill Touch](/doc/chill-touch-Z1swCBPsEl)\n* [Consumption](/doc/consumption-YJcYPZMyut)\n* ???\n\n\\\n",

Unlike most spiders, holler spiders are easy to domesticate, as they have a friendly disposition toward humanoids. They can be trained to act as sentries that recognize certain colors or livery, or they can be trained to respond to a certain person and sound alarms only when instructed. Some holler spiders can also be trained in different pitches or to carry a simple tune. This peculiarity has endeared them to nobles using holler spiders as fanfares at royal functions and to entertainers using the spiders to enhance their performances.",

When a cursed character makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, it must subtract 1d4 from the result.\n>\n> ### Actions\n>\n> ***Multiattack.*** The rat king makes four bite attacks.\n>\n> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:*  +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and a bitten creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease. A diseased creature gains one level of exhaustion immediately. When the creature finishes a long rest, it must repeat the saving throw. On a failure, the creature gains another level of exhaustion. On a success, the disease does not progress. The creature recovers from the disease if its saving throw succeeds after two consecutive long rests or if it receives a *lesser restoration* spell or comparable magic. The creature then recovers from one level of exhaustion after each long rest.\n>\n> ***Summon Swarm (1/Day).*** The rat king summons three swarms of rats. The swarms appear immediately within 60 feet of the rat king. They can appear in spaces occupied by other creatures. The swarms act as allies of the rat king. They remain for 1 hour or until the rat king dies.\n>\n> ### Reactions\n>\n> ***Absorption.*** When the rat king does damage to a rat or rat swarm, it can absorb the rat, or part of the swarm, into its own mass. The rat king regains hit points equal to the damage it did to the rat or swarm.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=94a30da9-b4c1-41ce-82aa-89b43166a2a5)\n\n## Rat King\n\n*A great knot of scabrous rats scrabbles together as a mass, with skulls, bones, and flesh entangled in the whole. Teeth, eyes, and fur all flow as a single disturbing rat swarm walking on two legs.*\n\n***Fused at the Tail.*** A rat king forms when dozens of rats twist their tails together in a thick knot of bone and lumpy cartilage\u2014and offer praise to the rat demon Chittr'k'k. Its numbers and powers grow quickly.\n\n***Rule Sewers and Slums.*** The rat king is a cunning creature that stalks city sewers, boneyards, and slums. Some even command entire thieves' guilds or hordes of beggars that give it obeisance. They grow larger and more powerful over time until discovered.\n\n***Plague and Dark Magic.*** The rat king is the result of plague infused with twisted magic, and a malignant ceremony that creates one is called \"Enthroning the Rat King.\" Rats afflicted with virulent leavings of dark magic rites or twisted experiments become bound to one another. As more rats add to the mass, the creature's intelligence and force of will grow, and it invariably goes quite mad.\n\n[https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#rat%20king%5Ftob](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#rat%20king%5Ftob)\n\n\\\n\\\n",

Before approaching, they send a letter to Calem the Druid. Bahruhn pulls a few fingers from his bag, and Murder the one-eyed crow hops down from a tree. They write a note to Calem asking how the antidote is coming along, tie it with string, and Murder takes it and flies off into the night.\n\n> *A faint, purplish glow ahead pierces the murk, guiding your gaze to a structure that defies both time and reason. Witchlights dart through the well tended garden playfully, the mist clinging to their luminescence leaving faint trails behind them. You walk over an old stone bridge, lichens clinging to every surface as a brook gurgles below you in the dark. The lower floor of the mansion is hewn from ancient stone, a large circular tower that long ago lost it\u2019s spire and now only remains as the first floor of this structure, surrounded by old growth trees. Built on top of the stone, the stories above are a purple house with sharp, Victorian peaked windows, adorned with intricate golden elvish carvings that curl and twist like vines along it\u2019s sharp angles.*\n>\n> \\\n> *The house leans ever so slightly, as if bowing to the ancient trees that cradle it on either side. Stained-glass windows glimmer with an welcoming candle light, casting a warm glow on the stone path that leads up a stone stoop to a large wooden door.*\n\n\\\nThe party approaches to knock, but the door swings up just as they walk up the steps, \u201cAh! There you are, I\u2019ve been expecting you!\u201d an elvish woman with silver hair exclaims. \u201cI am the [Lady Nyssara](/doc/lady-nyssara-J5Xln2dPek), my sister told me you were coming.\u201d she eyes Ramoth with interest.\n\nShe leads them into the house into an inviting sitting room with a roaring fire, ancient books line the walls and stacks of tomes are haphazardly piled up everywhere. [Tressym](/doc/tressym-EwTC8LwaoW) cats dart around the room, chasing each other through the air as Nyssara shoos them away and welcomes the party to sit on overstuffed leather couches. A mage hand floats in with a tray of tea. Anderdingus peers at the tomes scattered about and sees elvish writing he can\u2019t read, but can plainly see they are arcane-mechanical texts, very old, with many diagrams of elvish machinery.\n\n\u201cYou know my sister, [Nerium](/doc/nerium-fGANF3SomK)?\" she looks at Ramoth again inquisitively. \u201cLong ago, as I think you know, this place was called [Avalon](/doc/avalon-7amKaC2AMg), before it was [destroyed](/doc/the-doom-of-avalon-wVeAiTDpDF) and became a magic wasteland. Abandoned by the mortals this place became a magnet for the undead\u2026 the lack of life allowed the darkness to creep in. I and those who few were left attempted to fortify ourselves and rebuild on this island, but we were few in number, and the wild magic had changed us\u2026. we no longer aged. We could no longer leave. We were like prisoners in our own homes.\u201d\n\n\u201cNerium is the only one who could break the bond, although she has never said what price she paid. And I suspect she is in dire straits if she has enlisted mortals such as yourself.\u201d\n\nThe party asks about the portals & what Nyssara knows of the [Lady Nightshade](/doc/lady-nightshade-3kjLNj2Zbs)\u2019s plots.\n\n\u201cWe have not been able to get repair the portals of Avalon\u2026 there are hundreds, all dormant after the others left. As for the Lady, she too seeks the secret of the portals\u2026 and I fear her plans are accelerating\u2026.\u201d\n\nShe walks to the window and throws back the curtain. Across the dark waters of the Saltmarsh river the party sees [a black cathedral](/doc/a-black-cathedral-fYVDA6cszh) with a column of light piercing the eternally dark sky of [Duskmire](/doc/duskmire-hJey19lfsu).\n\n\u201cI have heard that the [Knight Amelia](/doc/amelia-mAibH1T0Em) keeps a vigil. The [Crimson Court](/doc/crimson-court-cofX8ha90z) has been called to a meeting in 3 days time. For what purpose I do not yet know. Only vampires and the few Unseelie left sit on the Court, and our influence is limited to our 6 seats out of 50. Everyone on the court is anonymous\u2026 we must wear glyphed masks to hide our identities. It keeps the vampire houses enmeshed in their petty schemes for power, always plotting amongst themselves while the Lady controls the blood.\u201d\n\nThe party asks where the blood goes, how they might infiltrate further into the [Inner Circle](/doc/inner-circle-iVSnGQFWfT).\n\nNyssara explains that the blood is kept guarded by the [Bloodless Sentinels](/doc/bloodless-sentinels-UAT4Khzzp1) in [the armory](/doc/the-armory-UKhlNykjnQ) inside [Castle Nightshade](/doc/castle-nightshade-3ym9ZnkfeF)\u2019s walls. Nearly impossible for mortals to gain access, the blood is brought in in barrels under heavy guard.\n\nShe looks at Bahruhn, \u201cWhat about your followers of the dove? Their leader has been captured by [The Eye](/doc/eye-of-duskmire-zVMHbvUlGR). I had hoped they would aid us, but now she seems to be a bargaining chip for [Velryn Blackthorn](/doc/velryn-blackthorn-bgx7zYW1b0) to ascend to the Court.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome now, you are safe here, you look tired - let me escort you to the guest chambers. We can talk more in the morning.\u201d\n\nShe leads the party up a grand staircase, into the guest quarters and bids them good night.\n\nThe party stays up a little longer to talk over their plan. Anderdingus breaks out his tea kettle, and performs the [Stone Tea](/doc/stone-tea-ik79CS5iIM) ritual, giving his compatriots the gnomish power over the stone. Sneak into the Armory using their [Rings of Water Breathing](/doc/ring-of-water-breathing-hgx2rNwFjj) by hiding in blood barrels? Go to confront Amelia at the [Cathedral of Sargoth](/doc/a-black-cathedral-fYVDA6cszh)? Rescue [Mother Yara](/doc/mother-yara-dawnbringer-4dR2aoAXG6) from the dungeons of The Eye? Infiltrate the [Crimson Court](/doc/crimson-court-cofX8ha90z)?\n\nThey bed down for the night, dreaming of all the possibilities.\n\n# The Authorities Arrive\n\nThey are awoken near dawn by the sound of breaking glass. Heaving pounding on the wooden door of the mansion, then splintering as it gives in. They hear a shriek from Nyssara down on the first floor, \u201cThe Sentinels! They followed you! Hurry we must escape!\n\nThe party walks out onto the stair landing and sees 3 sentinels breaching the front door. Two two-headed dogs & a sentinel sprint in and move to attack Nyssara, while the other two take cover from the doorframe and launch a barrage of crossbow bolts.\n\nRamoth casts Sickening Radiance, catching the constructs in it\u2019s cloud. Ama uses [Fog](/doc/fog-cloud-bpCrF9XmLE) to hide the party from the projectiles, but the constructs are undeterred, marching through the chaos and raining down truncheon blows. Bahruhn counters with his [Propulsion Arm](/doc/propulsion-arm-Iz5yGRJaFK), Anderdingus [Enlarges](/doc/enlargereduce-fHFkrPbnaT) himself, and Nyssara attemps to push them back into the sickening miasma with [Force Wall](/doc/wall-of-force-50erXVHcoI). The constructs take heavy damage, and while the dogs fall to the party\u2019s counteract the sentinels are not so easily put off.\n\nNyssara calls out, \u201cQuick! Upstairs! There is an escape in the bedroom.\u201d Through the cover of the fog, the party makes a run up the staircase and Nyssara reveals a hidden door in the back of a wardrobe. They climb into it, and seal it behind them using their gnomish [Stone Shape](/doc/stone-shape-Ni4NXltKR3). Nyssara conjures a Light and they descend into the basement below the house.\n\n# Beneath Valona\n\nThey descend into the mansion\u2019s wine cellar, and Nyssara opens up a magically locked room containing her Crimson Court robe, mask, an obsidian knife, and ruby gem gavel. \u201cTake these if you think it will be useful\u201d\n\nThey make their way further into the cellar and find a room overtaken with mushroom mycelium, several [myconids](/doc/myconids-nieyTwKxFq) rooted in a fairy ring around some old rusty machinery, lichens and mycelium clinging to it. On top of a metal table they see several construct body parts, some discarded armor, and tools - the myconids humming softly and blowing spores onto it. Ama uses Speak with Plants and the myconids blow their pacifying friendship spores on her, which she accepts. They communicate through images, the signal traveling far through the mycelium network and they warn her: a giant spider is in the cavern beyond.\n\nThe others also breathe in the spores and feel the wisdom of the myconids. They make offerings in friendship, and the myconids respond by filling their empty flasks with [Spores of Delirium](/doc/spores-of-delirium-JpyH7CL4vS).\n\n# Skittering Horror\n\nIn the room beyond they find a massive cavern covered in a thick layer of cobwebs, the tiny bones and glass-like wings of faeries stuck in them, long dead. Using their darkvision they spy a hulking, three-story and eight-legged monster crawling across the ceiling. They use [Major Image](/doc/major-image-cGSQoPOqDR) to fake a fairy, and [Mage hand](/doc/mage-hand-1nhwE5UUt3) to disturb the web. They see the vibration travel through the web and the massive [Skittering Horror](/doc/skittering-horror-NGQIbn7oBa) goes after it, giving the party time to make a run for it across the cavern towards a small pinhole of moonlight on the opposite side.\n\nFinding the hole too small to fit through, they again use their Stone Shape to widen it and emerge into a fairy village, harp music and the scent of fresh baked sweets on the humid night air.",

Stealing the royal family\u2019s life force to extend both their lives, the King was led down a very dark path.

Under the necromancer\u2019s influence, the King continued to live for nearly two centuries but his body began to rot and decay and his kingdom devolved into chaos and corruption. \n\nNevertheless he took a new queen and managed to sire twins, although their appearance was most unusual - purple tinted eyes, pale green flesh, and jet black hair.

Their escort, Chris, is a springy young fellow with more than a few missing teeth. He\u2019s stopped at a checkpoint by some [Queen\u2019s Men](/doc/the-queens-men-xaYgpxxPXi) blocking the road, demanding he pay the usual toll. Craggy and Jorg step out, arms crossed, projecting a menacing aura towards the seemingly lone bandit. Before Chris can pay, Mallow steps forward and uses her Telepathic Speech to communicate with the Queen\u2019s Man, impersonating his very conscience, and convincing him to let the caravan pass without toll, lest he be disemboweled by the Minotaur and Dwarf standing before him.\n\n\\\nThe party arrives at Emberwood village without a hitch. Chris recommends they head to the [Skull & Sword](/doc/skull-sword-tavern-iojXWZVPWD) tavern to rest up, which they happily oblige. Sitting at the bar is a [silver order knight](/doc/knights-of-the-silver-order-FzbtcbSsrx), who tasks the party with claiming an outpost in the outer city after two of his men failed to do so. Mable and Quavence press the knight for information, trying to ascertain his goals. The knight, Devon, says that the Silver Order\u2019s goal is to destroy [delirium](/doc/delirium-JlNwOH9FMQ), as he takes a shard from his pocket and smashes his tankard on it, sending a pulse of wild magic throughout the tavern. The group decides to help, but not before Mable approaches an old lady sitting by herself in the corner. Upon inquiry, it\u2019s noted she has lost her dog, Snuggles. With an outpost to secure, soldiers to find, and a missing dog on the loose, the party makes their first trek into the outer city of [Galmaarden](/doc/new-galmaarden-03tcpxxc2t).\n\n\\\nUpon reaching the outpost, Mallow notices a [Queen\u2019s man](/doc/the-queens-men-xaYgpxxPXi) lurking behind one of the houses. He introduces himself as Diamond, and it turns out that his men have already secured the majority of the buildings. All but one of them, which is filled with [Haze Husks](/doc/haze-husk-QQetLIL8il). Mable negotiates to help claim the outpost in exchange for information on the old lady\u2019s missing dog. Diamond is skeptical of this request, but accepts. Quavence diligently scouts the perimeter of the building, uncovering an unfinished [glyph of warding](/doc/glyph-of-warding-QlcSBRrKoQ) at the north entrance. Unfortunately, no one in the party really knew what to do with this.\u00a0\n\n\\\nHaving prepared and strategized, the party decides to help Diamond and the Queen\u2019s men clear the husks in a two front attack, with Mallow and Mable attacking the north entrance, and Craggy, Quavence, and Jorg attacking the east entrance. Jorg\u2019s Great Weapon Mastery proved especially useful, eliminating 3 of the husks in grueling detail. With the husks defeated and the building clear, Diamond thanks everyone and leads the party to a room with three black dogs. Mable calls out to Snuggles, who is delighted by the sound of her name, but the other two dogs stand quiet, the only audible sound being the jingle of the collars around their neck that bear the sigil of the silver order.\n\n\\\nCraggy, noticing that there may be some potential foul play, casts [Charm Person](/doc/charm-person-UxSYwJXpea) on an unsuspecting Diamond who relents to the spell in a barrage of flirtatious compliments about his shiny pants. Craggy extracts information regarding the two remaining dogs\u2019 owners, who turn out to be silver order hound masters who recently tried to take the outpost from the Queen\u2019s men. Diamond admits to keeping them captive in a back room behind the kitchen. Still under the influence of Craggy\u2019s charm spell, Mallow convinces Diamond to release Mik and Aiden, the two silver order prisoners, claiming they will make good target practice for her spells. With the dogs and hound masters released, the party leaves the outpost firmly in the Queen\u2019s men\u2019s control.\u00a0\n\n\\\nAfter journeying back to the [Skull & Sword](/doc/skull-sword-tavern-iojXWZVPWD) tavern, Devon thanks the party for saving his two hound masters, but is visibly disappointed that the Queen\u2019s men have taken the outpost. He also thanks the party for rescuing all three of his dogs, to which Jorg questions the ownership of Snuggles, who clearly doesn\u2019t fit the bill for an attack dog. Devon asserts that he \u201cfound\u201d Snuggles and claims her as property of the Silver Order. Jorg doesn\u2019t buy this, and flashes his Silver Order Officer\u2019s insignia, to which Devon relents and releases Snuggles to the old lady. Night falls, and the party ends their first adventure safely in Emberwood Village.\n\n\\\nNotable NPC\u2019s\n\n* Chris - Caravan driver\n* Devon - Silver Order Sergeant\n* Mik - Silver Order Hound Master (rescued)\n* Aiden - Silver Order Hound Master (rescued)\n* Diamond - Queen\u2019s men outpost leader\\n\n\nNotable Developments\n\n* Mik, Aiden, and their hounds were rescued from Diamond\u2019s outpost\n* The Queen\u2019s men have full control of the outpost north of Emberwood\n* Diamond will realize that he was charmed\n* Snuggles is home\n\n ![Art By Steve || Greyson || Jorg](/api/attachments.redirect?id=dff5acf1-5206-4a25-8aec-5ee43b65b736)\n\n\\\n",

Having wrested the land from the gnomes in hard-fought battles, the dwarves took immense pride in building the city, hoping for it to stand as a monument of both dwarven battle victory and artisanal craft. The dwarves of Galmaarden happily toiled away in their mines and at their forges. Galmaarden continued to grow under the dutiful stewardship of its denizens. Trade was established with nearby towns, traveling merchants, and brave adventurers. But the world was far from a peaceful one, and not without conflict. Dangers still lurked, laying in wait to seize the right opportunity to attack the thriving dwarven city.\n\nOne particularly persistent danger for the dwarves of Galmaarden were local giants, making their homes in the nearby mountains that surrounded Galmaarden. Various clans often attacked dwarves traveling through the mountains and surrounding foothills. Sometimes clans would coordinate larger scale attacks on the city. In one such coordinated attack, a young dwarf lost his family and was taken captive by the giants.\n\nIn that harrowing battle, many brave dwarves lost their lives defending Galmaarden from the giants, and a young dwarf - Thrulrik Thunderheart, was captured - dragged away while watching his family fall to the giants. He was roughly tied up, and carried for days back to a giant settlement, a village of some sort nestled deep in the mountains. Expecting nothing short of a grisly death, only holding to the hope that it might at least be quick, Thrulrik was shocked to find himself seemingly adopted by a young-looking giant female. Later, he would learn she had lost a child recently and upon seeing Thrulrik she snatched him away, tending to his wounds and caring for him. Confused and shocked, Thrulrik accepted his fate, quietly mourning his lost family and the only home he\u2019d ever known.\n\nThe giantess, Pashka, took great care of Thrul, showing him kindness rare for a giant, and raising him as if he were her own. Her care however, was not shared by either her mate or the other giants of the clan. Ralden, Pashka\u2019s mate, wasn\u2019t perhaps quite as harsh as most, but only when Pashka was in their presence. Ralden forced Thrul to cook, clean, and tend to the household duties. Ralden also used Thrul in combat practice, as a \u201csparring partner\u201d, often beating him mercilessly under the guise of \u201ctraining\u201d. Pashka did her best to keep Thrul  out of harm\u2019s way, keeping him close by her side as often as she could. Not nearly often enough though. Pashka had begun apprenticing to become a Rune Carver, and when allowed she would bring Thrul along with her to lessons to keep an eye on him. \n\nMany years passed and Thrul was unaware of the events happening outside of the giant\u2019s village, the only world he really knew. He toiled away for the giants, viewed as little more than an obedient servant. But Thrul\u2019s discontent was growing, Pashka\u2019s kindness could never overcome the cruelty he often faced, and he began to nurture hope for an opportunity to make his escape. \n\nIn his time among the giants, he had learned a great deal more than just the menial labor he had been tasked with. His time spent sparring with the giants had taught him a great deal of how to handle himself in a fight, turning out to be quite adept in combat. More interestingly, his time spent with Pashka during her rune carving lessons had proven quite enlightening. Thrul had learned more about the secrets rune magic than almost any outsider could ever hope for. He kept this knowledge secret, playing dumb in front of the giants, and going over what he\u2019d learned in the dark of night when he was alone.\n\nFinally, the opportunity he was waiting for presented itself, and Thrulrik would not hesitate. The band of giants had decided to join with a number of other bands in a large raiding party. The vast majority of any giants of fighting-age would be gone, leaving fewer eyes on watch for weeks. Over a few days, Thrul scraped together whatever supplies as he could before he would escape. Then, on a fortuitously stormy night, in the dark of early morning he silently crept out of the village and out of his imprisonment.\n\nIn the first days of his escape, Thrulrik put as much ground between himself and the giants as possible. His knowledge of the surrounding areas was limited, but he was resourceful and motivated. He was able to survive and avoid recapture by the giants. At one point, he encountered a wild beast (TBD) that would surely have killed him, but he was saved by a small group of gnomes who attacked and killed the beast. In the fight, one of his gnomish saviors fell to the mighty beast, Thrulrik had been raised with a certain perspective on gnomes, but this event lay heavily on his conscience. \n\nEventually, Thrulrik was able to find his way back to Galmaarden, only to be devastated by what he found. The home he remembered was no more, destroyed by the calamity. Where were the dwarves? What exactly had happened to the once great city? In need of answers, Thrulrik began to explore the ruins, learning what he could about the disaster that had befallen the only real home he\u2019d ever known.\n\n## Personal Quest(s)\n\n* ***A Family Matter***\n  * Thrulrik has heard rumors of another Thunderheart dwarf seen somewhere in the city. He means to investigate and confirm whether this to be true or not. \n* ***A Lost Heirloom***\n  * Thrulrik comes from a line of great warriors. A magnificently crafted suit of plate armor has been handed down from father to son for generations. Thrulrik hopes to find his old home and learn what has become of his family\u2019s heirloom. \n\n\\\n",

They explore the town, seeing [Durradin\u2019s First & Last Chance](/doc/durradins-first-last-chance-tavern-NGdActufoR) with a \u201cComing Soon\u201d sign on it\u2019s door. They are torn on whether they should rest or get straight to drinking.\n\nOn the outskirts of town, they find the [Old Hendrix Farm](/doc/old-hendrix-farm-DNPKQvAKgi), fallen into decay with the fields gone to weeds. Inside several hooded figures huddle around lanterns and a small fire. \u201cGreetings brothers\u201d the cultists leader, a man who introduces himself as [Nathaniel Flint](/doc/nathaniel-flint-wZ99bEd1hD). He has a bit of [delirium](/doc/delirium-JlNwOH9FMQ) crystal embedded in his forehead, and invites the players to dine with them as they roast potatoes and bread in the fire. He speaks with great zeal and about how \u201cWe believe the delirium was a gift from the gods, to prepare for their return. It is not to be used for profit or the petty schemes of humanity. It is meant to purify us.\u201d The party is not really into this, and Hydrax looks around the hovel and finds some old teeth under a bed roll.\n\nNathaniel offers the party a job - escorting the caravan in the morning as they continue towards Galmaarden. He explains, \u201cWe have already been robbed by bandits on the road, and do not have any gold to pay. But we do have this\u2026\u201d and offers them a few crystals of delirium. They say they\u2019ll think about it, and go look for a bar.\n\n ![Aldor the Immense](/api/attachments.redirect?id=46ea1174-5cc0-4986-af83-f47c43d6e917)\n\nOn the way to the tavern, they stop in at the Caravan Court where several merchants are set up for the evening. They talk to [Aldor the Immense](/doc/aldor-the-immense-xzpcXjqD6D), who is indeed quite large and blows smoke rings as he talks up his magical wares (which they note, are quite expensive). They do a little trading before the part turns to a mysterious stall with a hooded figure, face darkened by a veil, who reaches out with a skeletal hand, \u201cWould you like your fortune read?\u201d\n\n* [Thrulrik](/doc/thrulrik-thunderheart-Djp93iAMK8) - The Hanged Man\n* [Hydrax](/doc/hydrax-riverscales-X23snPsgvb) - Three of Wands\n* [Craggy](/doc/craggylheim-groggut-zF0JwTQJsP) - Justice\n* [Quavence](/doc/quavence-stillwater-IxWr0lTtBc) - Queen of Pentacles\n\nThey ponder the meaning of this before departing.\n\n# The Alarm\n\nAs they make their way up the road, suddenly they hear an alarm coming from the [Watchtower](/doc/watchtower-EwNVMyiegT). Emberwood is under attack! Several men with drawn swords run forth screaming, \u201cto the bridge!!!\u201d\n\nThe bridge is overtaken with the night\u2019s fog, the river below not even visible. The party confronts a huge [Haze Hulk](/doc/haze-hulk-eglJDUHZ3D) with two mouths, as it plods it\u2019s way closer. Many [husks](/doc/haze-husk-QQetLIL8il) are sprinting down the length of the bridge and the party fights them off valiantly, although Thrulrik can\u2019t seem to find purchase for his warhammer.\n\nJust as the the great beast is almost slain, an armor clad knight of the [Silver Order](/doc/knights-of-the-silver-order-FzbtcbSsrx) rushes in and lands the killing blow. He turns to the party, \u201cWithout your help, we would have been overrun! Hail and well met! and introduces himself as [Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal](/doc/knight-captain-theodore-marshal-uziZDu3G4I), leader of the Watch and Lieutenant Silver Order here in Emberwood.\n\nHe invites them back to the Watchtower for a meal and ale. He propositions the party: in the morning, the Knight-Captain is taking his men to retake one of the city gate\u2019s from \u201cthose wretched dog-men\u201d. He wants to know, \u201cWill the party take over the Watch for a few days?\u201d They are given badges and free run of the Watchtower. The party agrees.\n\n#### Developments\n\n* The party explored [Emberwood](/doc/emberwood-village-1Vn0FtePMR), finding the [Falling Fire](/doc/followers-of-the-falling-fire-6l87uOJncb) cultists and their seer [Nathaniel Flint](/doc/nathaniel-flint-wZ99bEd1hD) taking shelter in the [old Hendrix Farm](/doc/old-hendrix-farm-DNPKQvAKgi).\n* They fought off a [Haze Hulk](/doc/haze-hulk-eglJDUHZ3D) and other aberrations that attacked from the north.\n* They impressed [Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal](/doc/knight-captain-theodore-marshal-uziZDu3G4I) of the [Silver Order](/doc/knights-of-the-silver-order-FzbtcbSsrx), who deputized them to take over the Watch while he takes his men on a mission.\n\n\\\n",

They meet the bartender, Brennan, a retired adventurer. He serves the unexpected guests some ale, \u201cI guess this is my soft opening.\u201d\n\nHe tells them he thought opening a tavern near such an adventuring attraction such as [Galmaarden](/doc/new-galmaarden-03tcpxxc2t) was a good way to build a business. He gestures to the large, open hole in the center of the tavern. \u201cAnd of course the main attraction, an endless dungeon beneath the earth. Or at least that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been told.\u201d As he talks, the lift begins to rise creakily and a platform emerges from below. Brennan calls out, \u201cAy [Bob](/doc/bob-dabbledob-h5DXNi32rE), how\u2019s the renovations going? Any trouble with the monsters down there?\u201d\n\nA friendly looking skeleton responds \u201cAlmost done clearing out the debris sir, we\u2019ll be in business soon! And no one bothers little old undead me. Your patrons on the other hand\u2026\u201d he cackles before turning the great crank and descending below again.\n\nAs the party talks, the door flies open and several tough looking, tattooed dwarves enter. They nod at Thrulrik - who recognizes them as the [Queen\u2019s Men](/doc/the-queens-men-xaYgpxxPXi) they met a few days ago - \u201cAy, it\u2019s the watch! Don\u2019t worry we\u2019re here to talk business with your friend here.\u201d\n\nThey approach the bar and sniff disdainingly at the ales. \u201cThose don\u2019t look like dwarven brews to me fellas. Don\u2019t you think in a dwarven city in a dwarven realm they should be serving dwarven ale?\u201d He says threateningly. \u201cOur Queen may not be in power yet but the ale trade is ours.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have some good ole dwarven brews soon, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be our first customer, right Brennan?\u201d They blow off the party and exit dramatically. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back\u201d\n\n## Knight-Captain\u2019s Return\n\nOut on the street, they hear a great commotion as several soldiers are carrying a stretcher through the streets with a bloodied man wrapped in bloody army atop it. \u201cMAKE WAY! We must get the Knight-Captain to the infirmary! Call the doctor! MAKE WAY!\u201d\n\nThe party goes to see what the commotion is and sees [Theodore Marshall](/doc/knight-captain-theodore-marshal-uziZDu3G4I), badly injured, apparently mauled by great beasts and badly hurt. They follow the procession back to the Watch Tower.\n\nThe soldiers clear a long table in the study and lay the bleeding Knight-Captain atop it. The cleric from the temple is called in, and they attempt to heal the captain. Harrowhark and Quavence watch and take notes as scientists themselves. The Captain babbles, \u201cThe god damn dogs\u2026 we lost a lot of good men.. Using [delerium](/doc/delirium-JlNwOH9FMQ) as a weapon\u2026 Didn\u2019t think they were capable\u2026\u201d\n\nThey ask if there\u2019s anything they can do and they are directed to consult with the mage [River](https://River), mage of the [Amethyst Academy](/doc/amethyst-academy-XCMbg6pJnf), who is lodging at the [Red Lion Hotel](https://https://Red Lion Hotel) at the western end of town.\n\nSeeing that the Knight-Captain has been stabilized yet still remains sick from the poison of delerium, they regroup and head back out into the town in search of answers.\n\n## Town Business\n\n ![Mage River](/api/attachments.redirect?id=107f57b1-383e-4523-a8cf-9720a42677db \"left-50 =152x254\")\n\nThe party heads over to the Red Lion Hotel, a once grand manor that seems to have been converted to a hotel. It\u2019s fading paint allude to better days. The door is answered by a very well dressed man with a silver beard who introduces himself as [Kosta Stavros](https://Kosta Stavros). He offers the party wine and welcomes them into the marbled hallway, gilded paintings line the wall and several bookshelves of curios. \u201cJust one moment, I will see if Mrs. River will receive you in the library.\u201d\n\nHe gestures for them to enter and they find a tiefling mage, wearing the purple robes of the Amethyst Academy, reading a tome and sipping tea by a warm hearth fire. \u201cAh the Watch, please have a seat. I hope I can be of assistance.\u201d\n\nThe party explains that the Knight-Captain was badly wounded, and that her order may have some information that would help him. The innkeeper Stavros returns with a platter of wine glasses, and she seems to guard her words until he leaves.\n\n\u201cI see. Unlike the [Silver Order](/doc/knights-of-the-silver-order-FzbtcbSsrx), we at the Academy view the delirium as an opportunity for those who have the insight and willingness to study it. She eyes Harrowhark and Quavence with interest. You seem like seekers as well, maybe we can help each other.\u201d\n\nShe explains that a mage of their order has absconded - \u201cSome say gone mad - although I think he chafed under our ethical rules. I do not know the deals, but funding for his research was cut off\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThis mage, [Oscar Yoren](/doc/oscar-yoren-RFyn9kEyvc), has set up his operations on the western end of Galmaarden. We believe he is still carrying out experiments, and he must have had some success for his laboratory is within the city walls\u2026 within the reach of the haze. How he has survived is a mystery.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrack down Oscar Yoren, we don\u2019t know but we believe he has knowledge of the Haze that may be of use to us\u2026 and the injured Knight-Captain. He and some expelled Academy students are working out of a place known as [Reed Manor](https://Reed Manor). Bring me his notebooks or his work product, and you will earn the Academy\u2019s favor.\u201d\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=05aa46f6-4b4f-4250-9584-3dabc02cc806)\n\n## Into the Dark City\n\nThe party takes this information gladly, and plans their expedition, stopping by to see [Aldor the Immense](/doc/aldor-the-immense-xzpcXjqD6D) in the market. They set out over the bridge and head north for a few miles, the haze-cursed city looming before them. As darkness sets in, they leave the road behind to head towards the river to find the Ferry Man. As they traverse a ravine with a rope bridge across it, they are beset by some strange mage who sends out dancing lights to dazzle them, and then fell wolves attack. As spells are slung across the ravine the party gets the upper hand and emerges from the fight mostly unscathed. They search a small hunter\u2019s shack and find amidst the ruins some of beer bottles emblazed with the logo of the [One Eyed Mountain Brewery](/doc/molten-hop-brewhouse-CfxGmUVYNA)\u2026 the former business of their dear friend Gilbert. Strange.\n\nThey continue on down towards the river, and find a haze-husk of a man waiting with a small row boat. Wordlessly, he holds out his hand and grunts. Each of the party deposits a gold coin into his hand and boards the ferry.",

Tressym get along well with others of their kind, but they rarely lair or hunt together. They peacefully ignore bats, faerie dragons, and the like, but they hate stirges and evil flying monsters such as manticores. They also enjoy teasing dogs.\n\nTressym feed on small rodents, birds, and insects, stalking and pouncing on prey much as normal cats do, but with the added advantage of flight. Tressym don't, however, attack nestlings or despoil eggs.\n\nTressym mate with others of their kind, but they don't mate for life. A tressym can also mate with a normal cat, though only one out of every ten of their offspring will be a tressym; the others will be normal cats.\n\nTressym have good memories, particularly when it comes to danger. For example, a tressym that sees a human use a *wand of lightning bolts* remembers the danger of \"sticks of wood held by humans\" for the rest of its life. A lucky, healthy tressym can live to be 20 years old.\n\nWith the DM's permission, a person who casts the *find familiar* spell can choose to conjure a tressym instead of a normal cat.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Source: [Storm King Thunder](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#tressym_skt)\n\n[https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#tressym%5Fskt](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#tressym%5Fskt)\n\n\\\n",

They continue to [Galmaarden](/doc/new-galmaarden-03tcpxxc2t), an ominous city tainted by haze, and reach the [Black Ivory Inn](/doc/black-ivory-tavern-dwK4zxrboT)'s ruins. Here, they seek [Oscar Yoren](/doc/oscar-yoren-RFyn9kEyvc)'s pioneering [Aqua Expurgo](/doc/aqua-expurgo-9ybF3xoHRi) to combat the haze sickness. After impressive negotiation by Craggy, optimized with a deception and charm mix, they secure an introduction to Oscar, witnessing the dark alchemical processes behind the miracle potion. Oscar offers them potions as a gesture of potential collaboration, all while revealing the arduous and secretive measures used in brewing. The night ends with the party sampling Aqua Expurgo, recovering from their ailments as they contemplate further involvement with Oscar's mysterious endeavors. \n\n### **Key Points** \n\n* The party left [Emberwood Village](/doc/emberwood-village-1Vn0FtePMR) and made their way down to the Drann River, encountering a ferryman severely touched by contamination. They paid him to ferry them across the river.,\n* The river water was described as rancid and contaminated, flowing out of the walls of Galmaarden. The party's boat ride was treacherous, and Craggy nearly fell into the water.,\n* During the boat trip, the party encountered a floating deer carcass that appeared dead yet winked at them, hinting at necrotic or magical influences in the river.,\n* A purple ooze creature emerged from the deer's body and attacked, engulfing Craggy and the ferryman. The party fought it off, with Thrulrik using his war hammer and stone strike ability to deal significant damage.,\n* After defeating the ooze, the ferryman fell into the river due to a [grease](/doc/grease-HV1mZtnTW1) spell but was saved by Thrulrik, who jumped into the contaminated water, adding to his contamination level.,\n* Upon reaching the city, the party found refuge under a porch during a rainstorm, which was described as oily and metallic-tasting, suggesting contamination from the haze.\n* Craggy discovered, through investigation, that dark truth serum was found in barrels during their rest under the porch, highlighting the presence of alchemical substances in the area.,\n* The party encountered a massive construct in the city, described as a 25-foot-tall robot with a long sword, guarding a square. They created a distraction using a major image spell, allowing them to slip by unnoticed.,\n* The party reached [Reed Manor](/doc/reed-manor-pg5IXCjPL0), a potential residence of Oscar Yoren, surrounded by an overgrown yard. A massive toad in the fountain and a hulking figure patrolling indicated the manor's inhabitants.,\n* They were let into the manor by a hulking guard and met Taryn, a woman preparing stew, and later, [Rorsh](/doc/rorsh-the-mage-umxTjXQj7k), who accused them of spying but eventually offered to do business with them.,\n* Oscar Yoren offered the party three vials of \"Aqua Expurgo,\" a potion that protects against the haze, in exchange for potential help gathering ingredients to scale his operation.,\n* The party debated their next steps, considering whether to align with Oscar Yoren or to pursue their original mission to obtain Oscar's notes for River.,\n* Upon taking the \"Aqua Expurgo,\" the party members felt significantly relieved from their contamination symptoms, suggesting its effectiveness.,\n* Rorsh mentioned the potion allows them to remain unaffected by the haze, highlighting Oscar Yoren's breakthrough in alchemical research.,\n* Oscar Yoren alluded to needing additional ingredients, potentially delirium, to manufacture more of his potion, indicating a future quest opportunity for the party.\n\n### Fun Moments\n\n* Thrulrik jokes about his unique drinking habits: \"I'll let Craigie and I handle the drinking, and he can just watch\" in response to Quavence's experiments on their allies.,\n* Quavence's unique perspective on his animated corpse helper: \"You know, like, if you have a pet, a pet mouse, it's kind of interesting. You don't want to lose it, but it's not too terrible. You can get another mouse.\"\n* Craggy's analog to modern businesses: \"What if it wants a fucking tip after that? Does it flip around an iPad screen on us or something?\" when discussing the ferryman.\n* A comedic insight on the group's dynamics from Craggy: \"I agree, man. This team works. We drink, and he knows things,\" appreciating Quavence's intelligence in navigating their environment.,\n* When contemplating stealth tactics, Craggy\u2019s quip, \"Stealth is for rich women on a diet. Maybe that was clear liquors,\u201d shows confidence that made everyone chuckle.\n\n# Session 9: Beneath Reed Manor\n\n### Recap\n\nIn this session, Hydrax and Harrowhark trudge through a rain-soaked [Galmaarden](/doc/new-galmaarden-03tcpxxc2t), feeling the effects of contamination after entering the city's walls. They join friends Quavence, Thrulrik, and Craggy, reuniting to investigate [Reed Manor](/doc/reed-manor-pg5IXCjPL0)'s eerie happenings. They encounter a creepy ogre guard, who allows them passage into the manor, where they find their companions indulging in beer soup. As the night unfolds, screams interrupt their rest, prompting them to explore the manor. Harrowhark uncovers a secret door leading to a lab run by the dubious [Oscar Yoren](/doc/oscar-yoren-RFyn9kEyvc). Inside, they are ambushed by undead horrors\u2014a show of Yoren's dark experiments. Hydrax heroically smashes through a stone prison door, joining the fray as the party battles the monstrosities and faces off against Yoren's sinister machinations. While gathering evidence of the necromancer's schemes, Oscar escapes, leaving the adventurers to deal with a horde of zombies. As dawn breaks, the party flees with valuable alchemical notes, dragging an unwilling Rorsh along as they contemplate what to do with their unexpectedly acquired 'guest.'\n\n### Key Points\n\n* Harrowhark and Hydrax follow their friends to Reid Manor, seeking medicine from Oscar Yoren, a disgraced mage, despite the purple haze contamination affecting them.,\n* Upon reaching Reed Manor, they encounter ogres guarding the entrance. After some negotiation, they are admitted inside under the guise of being on business.,\n* Inside, the group reunites, sharing tales of past adventures and ailments, including Hydrax's encounter with a vomit ooze, which Harrowhark finds intriguing for research.,\n* Oscar Yoren, described as a man in a filthy lab coat, offers hospitality and warns of not having enough vials to spare for contamination treatment unless paid.,\n* Discussions reveal Oscar's need for [Eldritch Lilies](/doc/eldritch-lily-B7ywkNMMT1), which are symbiotic with the haze, as a crucial ingredient for his concoctions.\n* Oscar's hidden laboratory is discovered through a secret door, revealing his dark experiments on mutated corpses and hints of dark magic involving a phylactery.,\n* Trapped in the laboratory, the group faces off against animated corpses and an arcane wraith, using various spells and tactics to survive the encounter.,\n* Oscar and a demon are revealed to be behind the grotesque experiments, seeking to harness souls for dark purposes. Oscar attempts to flee with a crystal containing souls.,\n* The group recovers Oscar's notes, albeit in coded form, and learns the general location of where Eldritch Lilies grow. They contemplate capturing Rorsch, Oscar's assistant, for more information.,\n* A desperate Oscar attempts to cast a powerful spell, but is thwarted by his inability to speak due to Harrowhark's disease spell, preventing further magical attacks.,\n* After a fierce battle, the group decides to gather their findings, loot the laboratory, and plan their escape, contemplating the fate of Rorsch, who possesses partial knowledge of Oscar's process.,\n* The party considers the implications of their actions, including the potential to align with Rorsch or extract more information from him about Oscar's operations.,\n* Ultimately, the session ends with the group escaping Reid Manor, taking Rorsch with them as dawn breaks over Galmarden, setting up further plans for their next moves.\n\n### Fun Moments\n\n* Hydrax proposed a sneak approach but comically announced, \"I was actually gonna bribe this guy if he didn't let us through,\" after the ogre let them pass without issue.,\n* Quavence lamented the seemingly mundane but defining aspect of D&D with, \"It's a game where you imagine that you're drinking beer,\" as the group gathered over ales.,\n* Thrulrik humorously surmised about the team\u2019s health insurance situation by saying, \"I think we screwed up losing our health insurance when we left the deputy service.\"\n* Quivance was puzzled about enchanting effects and mentioned, \"Do I float?\" and his mates joked about him being 30 pounds and needing to float like something made of styrofoam.,\n* The group's brainstorming on their next move took a detour when Craggy quipped, \"I'm not playing seven minutes in heaven with you, buddy,\" as Hydrax considered hiding in a closet to ambush foes.\n\n\\\n",

They said The Incident was an earthquake, but it felt more like the ground tore itself open and spat him out. He was a minotaur, big as an ox, twice as strong, and far cleverer than most would guess. In those first days, when wagons needed guarding and petty lords raised their own militias, he sold his sword and his strength. Soldiers were always in demand.*\n\n*Before long, his size and a quick wit earned him a sergeant\u2019s stripes, and then the rank of an officer. But leading troops was a test of one\u2019s patience as much as one\u2019s blade. Jorg had little taste for licking boots or shouting orders. Men were easier to wrestle than bureaucracy. He saw the drums of war on the horizon, felt them shiver in every bone. A real war, he knew, would clamp him in chains no less binding than any dungeon. So he left before the banners could claim him.*\n\n*Galmaarden\u2019s streets were thick with carrion in those days\u2014plague, murder, or simple misfortune feeding the crows. Jorg took on the work no one else would, hauling corpses to the pyres. Pay was thin, but it bought him freedom. Evenings found him hunched over old manuscripts, learning all he could of the city\u2019s dark histories, searching for scraps of magic. They whispered about powers beneath Galmaarden\u2019s foundations, seeping into its walls and alleys, though folk were quick to turn suspicious eyes on anyone too curious.*\n\n*Each night, Jorg lit a candle and dreamed that one day he might snap his thick fingers and kindle its wick by will alone. A small trick, but a damnable ambition in a place where men who dabble in sorcery often vanish. Until then, he was content to labor by day and study by night, flickering flames dancing across the page while he soaked in all the knowledge he could. Someday, if the gods were kind\u2014or cruel enough\u2014he might change the city as much as it changed him. For now, he remained his own master, bull-headed and unbound, carving his path through the shadows of Galmaarden.*",

They are in search of a little rest and relaxation and seek the fabled [Black Ivory Tavern](/doc/black-ivory-tavern-dwK4zxrboT), for they have heard that the musician who performs there is of uncanny ability & beauty.\n\nAs they turn the corner to find their destination, they are accosted by a [follower of the Falling Fire](/doc/followers-of-the-falling-fire-6l87uOJncb), his face scarred purple by haze and his cloak tattered. He points to the tavern and tells the adventurers that his brother, Balasar the Gnome, may have fallen into temptation in the inn of ill repute. \u201c[Father Fiz](/doc/fiz-junkbrand-6fvhYAH5OE) forbids us from drink, it interferes with our communion of crystals. I have a history with cider myself\u2026\u201d\n\nHe offers the party 200 gold to if they can drag his compatriot out, which gets their attention.\n\n# The Show\n\nThey are greeted at the door by an impeccably dressed dwarf, \u201cWelcome gentleman, will you be sitting at the bar or would you like a table for this evening\u2019s performance?\u201d\n\nThey state the bar, and he leads them in. The doorman points out \u201cOpen\u201d Mike, the proprietor, who is deep in a story with some drinking buddies. A hooded dragonborn smokes a pipe by the fire, and a wizard takes a seat nearest the stage.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=a8922217-7b2b-4365-878d-313416e73754 \"full-width\")They look around and don\u2019t see the aforementioned gnome, and get drinks by the bar. They chat up the other patrons, Hydrax approaching the proprietor just in time to hear his owlbear hunting story. Thrulrik & Craggy chat up some noble dwarf ladies who seem to be from another era, talking of the dwarven kingdom.\n\nA drunk patron bumps into Open Mike, spilling his beer, and he stands to chastise them, causing a scene, which the doorman rushes over to smooth over. Hydrax wanders over to the hooded dragonborn and makes conversation.\n\nA man comes through the kitchen, and talks with the bartender in a very familiar manner, \u201cAnother round for the boys! I gotta take a piss I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d and he walks outside.\n\nThrulrik notices that instead of the ruined street & night outside, he sees the gleaming streets of a perfect spring day, people sitting in cafes.\n\nHe runs back to tell the others, when the performance begins.\n\nA beautiful elven redhead woman comes out onto the stage and takes a bow. \u201cI am Miss Charlotte, and ever single I was a young girl, my only wish was to be the greatest living musician that ever lived. Seeing all you here tonight makes me think it\u2019s come true.\u201d\n\nShe plays at both the harp and piano, transfixing the crowd who watch in raptured silence until she takes a break and heads over to the bar for intermission.\n\nSomeone steps on a [tressym](/doc/tressym-EwTC8LwaoW) cat, and it yowls and goes flying around the room. Open Mike calls out, \u201cGet that damn thing out of here! Free beer for whoever grabs it!\u201d the crowd cheers.\n\nMiss Charlotte resumes her set, but the building shakes as if from an earthquake. A purple light begins to shine through the window, and then the whole building is set aflame and smashed apart as if from an explosion!\n\nMiss Charlotte stands on the stage still singing, watching the chaos & the party burn. A purple crystal sticks out of a gaping wound in her chest. Her song goes on.\n\nThe party dies in the fire\u2026.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=904348ce-fcb0-4718-9b72-0913bde9a3a9)\n\n# You Meet in a Tavern\n\nThe smell of smoke fades and the party opens their eyes, standing on the porch of the tavern again.\n\nThey are greeted at the door by an impeccably dressed dwarf, \u201cWelcome gentleman, will you be sitting at the bar or would you like a table for this evening\u2019s performance?\u201d\n\nThey state the bar, and he leads them in. The doorman points out \u201cOpen\u201d Mike, the proprietor, who is deep in a story with some drinking buddies. A hooded dragonborn smokes a pipe by the fire, and a wizard takes a seat nearest the stage.\n\nGreyson looks confused, as it dawns on the others what\u2019s happening: they\u2019re stuck in a time loop before the calamity rained down on Galmaarden.\n\nThey go in to the bar. Where\u2019s that gnome, anyways? This time they wait for the spilled beer and commotion to take the tray of beers the man leaves on the bar & slip into the kitchen, where they find a grisled old gnome stirring a stew pot. They take the stairs down into the cellar, finding it looking fairly ordinary. Except in the far corner, a locked down with an eye hole. They knock, and a somewhat drunk woman answers, \u201cWaddya want???\u201d\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=ef7065ae-c5cd-4663-a4da-654d334a814a \"full-width\")\n\n\u201cWe brought the beers down\u201d\n\nInside they find a bunch of pirate sailors playing Dragonchess. They make friends immediately by putting up some money and getting down to a few rounds. A youngish boy comes back down and takes his post standing guard at a very locked door to the east.\n\nWith a little bribery and persuasion, they send the boy back up to the bar and unlock the door, slipping inside to find a giant monster, a fleshy mass of beast with sticky tendrils and the shape of a piano sticking out of it\u2019s back. They begin to fight it, but it engulfs Thrulrik and they feel the building shake. Soon, despite their efforts the ceiling caves in and they are \u201cdead\u201d once again.\n\n# You Escape From a Tavern\n\nThis time Hydrax is losing is, he goes over and asks the wizard if he knows what the fuck is up, but he just responds with how he is intent on recruiting Miss Charlotte as a promising bard talent for the Amethyst Academy. Miss Charlotte comes out to play, and Hydrax grabs his lance and begins to thrash the piano. He is pulled off by his compatriots who drag him into the kitchen to \u201cget him to sober up\u201d but they make a run for it down to the cellar, easily bargaining their way in with talk of gambling. When the boy leaves to go get the beers, he leaves the unguarded open for them. They rush and this time, with a well coordinated plan, they kill the foul beast and explore a tunnel that apparently leads under the wall and to a square inside the city, filled with haze husk monsters.\n\nThey then find themselves standing in the ruins of the tavern, back in the old familiar plane of existence.\n\nLooking through the ruins of the tavern, they find the burnt forms of the piano, Miss Charlotte, and Open Mike\u2019s [hunting bugle](/doc/guildmasters-hunting-horn-PkmJIssiGT).\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=03dc5eaf-c97c-4fef-841d-6e1f03027469)",

Thunder growls in the distance, a low, ominous rumble that sets the air vibrating around you. Fat raindrops begin to fall, their impact against the cobbled streets a steady, rhythmic patter. The salty wind from the sea howls through the narrow alleys of the town, tugging at your cloaks as you make your way toward the eerie sight ahead.*\\n\\n*Through the mist and the sheets of rain, you catch your first clear glimpse of [Eda Oweland](/doc/eda-oweland-HEslJp2L08)\u2019s mansion \u2014 no longer grounded in the earth but floating, a great mass of stone and soil suspended in the air. Its once-grand towers and wings of rooms are cracked and crumbling, and dark ivy creeping up the walls.*\n>\n> \\n*You approach what was the iron gate of the [Oweland manor](/doc/oweland-estate-pW6osn13sD), now encircling a giant crater in the earth from which the house lifted off. The Oweland crest is prominently displayed on the gate, a dragon with a longsword through it\u2019s heart.*\n\nThe party, gathered here by the [Saltmarsh Council](/doc/saltmarsh-council-8KxfpMfTQ0), introduces themselves and turns their attention to the gate. As they approach it, they find it locked. The dragon on the crest suddenly is animated by a [Magic Mouth](/doc/magic-mouth-u6HmPDk6fp) spell:\n\n\n:::warning\n*\u201dHail and well met! Are you friend or foe? What brings you to the Oweland Manor?\u201d*\n\n:::\n\nThey answer that they are friends (kind of) and that they are here on Council business. The dragon informs them that there is a family reunion under way, so Mrs. Oweland is busy but may be able to get them in if it\u2019s town business. The gate clicks open.\n\n> *You approach the crater within the walled gates, and you see a small dock, hastily assembled out of remnants of the house floating above. Tethered to it with a rope is a small skiff - it\u2019s dark, polished hull glistens with rain, the wood unnaturally smooth, as if untouched by time or wear.* \n\nA small rope ladder hangs down from the side, which the party boards the ship. Ranger goes over to the captain\u2019s wheel and gives it a spin, and the whole boat lurches strongly to the left, throwing Hydrax to the deck. The ships seems to resist Ranger\u2019s sudden pull, and rights the ship under it\u2019s own accord. After some discussion of air ship mechanics, they decide to simply ask the ship if it can go. It complies, and the ship ascends toward the house.\n\n# Unfriendly Skies\n\nAs the ship ascends through the clouds and rain, the party pokes about the ship and finds some old barrels and boxes. Picking through them they find\u2026 a severed hand. Folwin & Aten immediately recognize it as undead in nature. As they examine it, a [zombie vulture](/doc/zombie-vulture-Uc0z6ODNRp) alights on the bow of the ship and makes a grab for the undead hand. As a fight breaks out, many bloodthirsty [stirges](/doc/stirge-fmD9b2LT3s) descend on the party and they get busy whacking them and shooting from the ship\u2019s crossbows. The vulture steals the hand in the melee and takes off.\n\n# The Manor\n\nThe ship docks itself at the floating earthmote and the party disembarks. The storm rages around them and lightning flashes across the sky. Several trees and statues are toppled over and torches burn at the door. The party approaches and two of the statues come to life, \u201cWHO GOES THERE? NAME YOUR BUSINESS BEFORE THE OWELANDS!\u201d\n\nThe party answers they are on town business and the statues promptly say, \u201cWell ok then\u201d and turn back into stone. The party enters and finds a house in disarray, the walls are crumbling in.\n\nThey almost immediately see a [large octopus](/doc/large-octopus-9kUTuqffFJ) on a table, surrounded by ritual magic components and the whole thing surrounded by a circle of salt. They step through and poke at it and it comes to life, lashing out and grappling the intruders with it\u2019s tentacles.\n\nA hole opens up in the salt circle, and it begins to creep out. The party frees the grappled and throws some salt at the octopus, and it cowers in fear from them. They close the circle and leave it behind.\n\n# Arcane Signs\n\nAs they make their way through the rooms and floors of the manor, they find more evidence of arcane rituals. In the floor above a library has some sort of magical abberation making the ground shimmer pink. The party of course throws themselves into it, and they all receive a very strange magical effect, including turning Ranger Jarfi invisible. Poking about the library they find another severed, undead hand and a book of necromancy that appears to belong to the wizard [Keledek](/doc/keledek-the-wizard-jGCH5H0n7q). They place the severed hand on the book and it transforms into a [Mage Hand](/doc/mage-hand-1nhwE5UUt3) that follows them around. They ask it where Keledek is, and it dips it\u2019s finger in ink and writes on the wall *\u201cLOST!!\u201d*\n\nSeveral small brains with legs, about the size of a small dog, run around this floor. The party ignores them and pushes up further into the house\n\n# Mrs. Oweland\n\nThey enter the office of [Mistress Eda Oweland](/doc/eda-oweland-HEslJp2L08), who is levitating a few feet above her couch and having a nice cup of tea. The lights here are strange, emanating an arcane light unnaturally. The party asks her if she\u2019s ok, and what\u2019s she been up to. They have a nice conversation about the goings on in the town\n\n> ***\u201cYou\u2019ve come to meddle in things you don\u2019t understand. But perhaps... perhaps you can still serve a purpose. Saltmarsh needs allies. Real ones.\u201d***\\n\\n***\u201dThe sahuagin are not the real threat. The Riders are. They use fear to control us, and the sea devils are merely their pawns. I can offer you the means to destroy them both, if you\u2019re willing to help me resurrect the glory of my family.\"***\n\nMrs Oweland is convinced that the \u201cforeigners\u201d (meaning the Iron Riders) are plotting to seize power, and only the old heroes of Saltmarsh can help save the town. The only problem is she was working with the wizard Keledek, but he was executed and has since gone missing. The party has seen signs that he is still somewhat attached to the material realm, which pleases Mrs. Oweland. She begins to trust them.\n\nShe tells them she has been trying to bring back [Sir Thomas \u201cThe Dragon Slayer\u201d Oweland](/doc/sir-thomas-oweland-A6kJDPu7SS) - founder of Saltmarsh and patriarch of the Oweland\u2019s. But something went terribly wrong with her attempt at the ritual - and unfortunately he was brought back as a [gibbering mouther](/doc/gibbering-mouther-TgplvjaPZM) aberration. This is the true reason she needs Keledek\u2019s help. The party tells her they know of the Iron Riders schemes, as they have already [met with the lizardfolk](/doc/fort-lizard-CfYdXbz6UM). They agree to help her find the wizard and - hopefully - help save the town.\n\nAs a final favor, she asks them to round up all the brain dogs. The party chases them through the house and stuffs them in a sack for later use.\n\n\\\n\\\n",

To attune to this item, you must attach it to your arm at the wrist, elbow, or shoulder, at which point the prosthetic magically forms a copy of the appendage it's replacing.\n\nWhile attached, the prosthetic provides these benefits:\n\n* The prosthetic is a fully capable part of your body.\n* You can take an action to remove the prosthetic, and it removes itself if your attunement to it ends. It can't be removed against your will.\n* The prosthetic is a magic melee weapon with which you're proficient. It deals 1d8 force damage on a hit and has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When thrown, the prosthetic detaches and flies at the target of the attack, then immediately returns to you and reattaches.\n\n***Thrown.*** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Source: [ERLW](https://5e.dungeon.church/items.html#arcane%20propulsion%20arm_erlw) \n\n[https://5e.dungeon.church/items.html#arcane%20propulsion%20arm%5Ferlw](https://5e.dungeon.church/items.html#arcane%20propulsion%20arm%5Ferlw)\n\n\\\n",

They hear laughter from a corner booth as a young [Amethyst Academy](/doc/amethyst-academy-XCMbg6pJnf) mage literally bets his shirt in the dice game a bunch of surly looking dwarves are playing. Thrulrik and Jorg sidle up to overhear what\u2019s going on - Thrulrik recognizes their dwarven supremacy tattoos - symbols usually associated with the [Queen\u2019s Men](/doc/the-queens-men-xaYgpxxPXi). Meanwhile Quavence buys his [haze husk](/doc/haze-husk-QQetLIL8il) they captured a beer so he doesn\u2019t get thrown out. \u201cAs long as he\u2019s drinking\u2026\u201d Gorthar says wearily.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=1715255d-9379-4643-8fb8-c2cd0775aa2a)\n\nThe young mage literally loses his shirt, and very sloshed, heads over to the bar, \u201cGorthar, lemme get one more on credit man - damn dwarves took all me coin\u201d he begs but the bartender tells him to pay up or get the fuck out. \u201cMe friends will be here soon anyways, we got a big plan tonight\u2026 gonna find the fancy scepter\u201d he slurs. The party takes a lot of interest in this and begins to question the mage, who says his name is [Rorsh](/doc/rorsh-umxTjXQj7k). Just as he begins to tell a tale \u201cWell we\u2019re going over to near the wall, there\u2019s this chapel there you see\u2026\u201d he cuts off as several purple-clad Amethyst associates barge in the door. \u201cRorsh! Shut up man! Don\u2019t be talking about our business! And where\u2019s your shirt? That\u2019s gonna cost you!\u201d the friends hustle their drunken friend out the door and glare at the party.\n\nOur heroes decide to follow them, and sneakily make for the door where they see the band of mages headed north, on the path towards the outer walls of Galmaarden\n\n# The Chapel\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=5ed80e13-5328-4183-8b6f-4320ea7f22da)\n\n> *A deteriorating chapel lies atop a small hillock in the middle of a desolate residential borough. Despite heavy damage, its domed slate roof rises above the surrounding townhouses. Two cylinder-shaped towers flank the arched double-door entrance. One tower has completely collapsed into a mound of stone rubble roughly fifteen feet high, leaving a great breach leading into the chapel at ground level. The other tower remains standing up to the second storey. Piles of debris and stone surround the tower's base. Elegant arched windows filled with stained glass mosaics decorate the chapel, but most are shattered and broken.*\n\nThe party follows at a distance, shadowing the other group, successfully using the night as cover as they leave the village of [Emberwood](/doc/emberwood-village-1Vn0FtePMR) behind. As they enter the ruined outskirts of the city, the great walls looms ahead, the moon catching the purple haze boiling beyond it.\n\nThey see the other group turn a corner, and following, they find themselves standing at a large dome chapel. Thrulrik vaguely remembers in the time before he was kidnapped that this was a place his family would come.\n\nPassing through the open gate they decide to scout around the main chapel building, and so go over to a walled garden where they find the other group of mages standing around a statue holding a metal rod scratching their heads. Coarse words are exchanged, and the two parties come to fisticuffs, which ends in one unconscious and another mage fleeing his comrades using invisibility. Questioning the remaining Amethyst Academy recruit \u201cThis is all a misunderstanding!\u201d - who ensures them that their leader will not be happy to hear of this mandhandling - says something about how they are looking for the \u201c[Scepter of Saint Vitruvio](/doc/scepter-of-saint-vitruvio-rT3z7f9t1e)\u201d somewhere beneath the chapel.\n\nThey examine the strange statue, and discover that it is actually holding an Immovable Rod. Behind the statue they find a grate which Jorg busts open and they descend to the crypt below.\n\n# Undercroft\n\nExploring the crypt, they find a fountain of fresh water and some strange mechanisms embedded in the ground. Using their Immovable Rod, they figure out that it\u2019s some sort of winch, controlling something below them they can hear moving as they turn the stone cylinders. Deciding to explore a little more before descending further, they pass into a large western chamber where they are confronted by several grumpy [mephits](/doc/steam-mephit-RsvOfpU21i) who demand a toll of a gem in a menacing manner. They produce such a stone, and quickly shut the door before the mephits can shake them down for anything further.\n\nDeciding they better not go that way, they go further into the crypt, taking the stairs down\u2026.\n\n# The Crypt\n\nThey find that there is a large porticulis that looks to have been raised by the mechanism they manipulated above. Passing under it warily they come to a crypt, with alcoves of coffins surrounding a dark brazier full of coals. Many [skeletons](/doc/skeleton-ScNMTHQhwp) are visible laying in respite, some clutching valuable looking weapons and other things that tempt the party. Of course, as they attempt to steal from the dead they are raised and the party plays whack-a-mole with the undead, sending them to their final rest.\n\nIn a large room, they find a [mummified body](/doc/mummy-9U5E5q5Z7o) wrapped in rotting rags atop a funeral pyre that seems to have never been lit. In it\u2019s hand is the scepter they seek. They ready their attacks as the mummy rises. \u201cTraitor! Grave robbers!\u201d it shrieks.\n\nThe party, outnumbering this undead creature, surround him and rain down blows but take some damage from the mummy\u2019s rotting fist. Thrulrik has a hard time of it, while even Quavence\u2019s corpsewrought creature manages to land some blows. After throwing everything they have at the foul beast, they manage to destroy it, with Jorg taking his pitchfork and unraveling the mummy like it\u2019s cold spaghetti.\n\nThey take the valuable artifact and decide to high tail it out of there.\n\n# The End\n\nThe party goes back up into the crisp night air and finds the Amethyst Academy mages smoking cigarettes outside. \u201cWell well, looks like you have something that belongs to us.\u201d Jorg tells them to fuck off and they run like scared civilians. They look through the actual chapel, finding some great loot and statues of dwarven saints from the times before the calamity. Thrulrik feels conflicted about looting his own people\u2019s temple, but here in [Galmaarden](/doc/new-galmaarden-03tcpxxc2t) only the ruthless survive.\n\nBack at the bar, Gorthar greets them. \u201cLooks like you\u2019ve had quit a night\u2026 by the way\u2026 any news from the Temple Gate? I hear the Silver Order is getting ready to clear that place of those dog creatures?\u201d\n\n### *Notable Developments*\n\n* Rorsh and his band of mage friends are recruits of the [Amethyst Academy](/doc/amethyst-academy-XCMbg6pJnf), attempting to make a name for themselves.\n* The party has made enemies of the [Academy](/doc/amethyst-academy-XCMbg6pJnf), stealing the [Scepter of Saint Vitruvio]() out from under them\n* [Queen\u2019s Men](/doc/the-queens-men-xaYgpxxPXi) are operating in [Emberwood Village](/doc/emberwood-village-1Vn0FtePMR) for unknown reasons.\n* They hear a rumor about the [Silver Order](/doc/knights-of-the-silver-order-FzbtcbSsrx) getting ready to take control of the Temple Gate\n\n\\\n",

Before the meteor struck it was known as Stavros Manor, home to a human [noble](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#noble_mm) named Kosta Stavros who served as Reeve of Emberwood Village. After narrowly avoiding destitution when Drakkenheim was destroyed, Stavros converted his home into a hotel that serves wealthy explorers, merchants, and nobles conducting business near Drakkenheim. He is an older man with a sallow face, thinning hair, and monocle, always garbed in a rich blue vest and doublet.\\n\n>\n> The three-storey manor is made of red brick. It features lion-shaped gargoyles, large glass-paned windows, and embossed wooden doors painted green with large brass lion knockers. The estate includes a dozen well-appointed bedrooms, each with their own private bath and common room. A full service staff provides patrons' every need. Meals are taken in a sumptuous dining room outfitted with an impressive crystal chandelier, and drinks are served in a vast parlour furnished with fine antiques and decorated with various sculptures, paintings, and bookshelves. Each room features a great hearth and lovely views which overlook the village or the surrounding countryside.\\n\\n\u2014 [DODK](https://5e.dungeon.church/adventure.html#dodk,3,red%20lion%20hotel,0) pg 60\n\n\\\n",

The scent of mildew and decay fills our nostrils as you finally emerge into a wide chamber. Piercing the darkness around you, to the west is a statue made of glass - a tall elven figure holding a scale in one hand and a glowing mace in the other, it\u2019s delicate features marred by the cracks of time and a layer of grime. The light refracts and dances along the walls like the reflection of water.*\\n\\n*To the east, the walls have caved in and fallen into a dark river of sludge that flows turgidly past you. In the north wall is a stone door etched with elvish runes and the symbol of a snake eating it\u2019s tail.*\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=eea03263-b2f8-4aa2-8a0f-695713ab70c8)\n\nRado approaches the statue, and they hear metal gears within the walls grind and begin to turn. Some sort of mechanism has been triggered. The statue raises it\u2019s glowing mace, and projected on the wall is an image of [5 towers](/doc/avalon-7amKaC2AMg). A winged shadow takes flight in the form of a small dragon, flying around the towers.\n\nThey examine the door to the north, translating the elvish script: `In light, there is shadow. In shadow, there is light.`\n\nReturning to the statue, Ama places her hand on them, tipping the scales.\n\nDark shadows billow out and the dragon takes flight into the room. The statue comes to life, taking a step off it\u2019s pedestal. It draws it\u2019s weapon, and one of the shadows coalesces into the form of a dragonborn conscript. They draw their weapons and attack each other.\n\nThe party attempts to fight them off but finds that their spells and weapons fly straight through them. Horrified and confused they back away from the dueling illusions and focus their attention on the shadowy forms. Ramoth recovers from her fright and joins the battle. Greyson sinks his magical dagger into them, and Rado fires off his magical missiles, taking them down. Ama pushes over the glass statue, shattering it on the stone floor. The light of the mace goes out and the room is plunged into darkness.\n\n# Constructs\n\nThe party continues through the door to the north, finding hallways that split off to the east and west and the foul sewer water flowing through a grate northward. Rado summons his familiar as a bat, and sends it flying through the corridor west. Through it\u2019s eyes he sees a room with a table strewn with parts of a construct - hands, a torso, a leg - surrounded by old rusty tools. The bat flies into a larger chamber flooded with sewer water. In the center of this room is a column and several doors leading further into the dungeon.\n\nDriving in a never ending circle are 3 constructs on a small mechanical boat, tethered to the column, swinging around the room like a demonic maypole. They ignore the bat as it flutters around them.\n\nThe party comes up with a plan to use their animated rope to clothesline the constructs, using Pass Without Trace to sneak past them as they sink into the muck, confused and prone. Rado casts Darkness to hide them. Ama uses her intangible form to pass through the door, and Greyson is able to quickly pick the lock to the west before the constructs can recover themselves and notice them to bring the others through. They slip into a stone chamber, shutting the door behind them and using their [Avalon Engineer\u2019s Signet](/doc/avalon-engineers-signet-63RXQwAWMe) to arcane lock it behind them. The constructs beat at the door fruitlessly.\n\n# The Last Keeper\n\nThe party finds several well kept chambers, one with 4 beds neatly kept. 3 of them have chains & manacles bolted to the wall above them. Lit torches line the walls, as if the space is being used. They continue through the next door.\n\n> *The passage narrows before opening into a surprisingly well-preserved chamber. Smooth walls of pale stone glisten faintly with moisture, carved with intricate patterns of leaves and vines. Broken furniture and rusted tools are scattered about. In the center of the room, a gaunt elf with hollow, sunken eyes and hair like cobways sits at a table muttering incomprehensibly. Around him, four ancient, mummified figures are chained to their chairs, their dessicated forms long decayed but still recognizable as elven. The plates piled high with decaying rats and flies buzz in the air. The elf stands up, rattling the chains that hold the corpses in place. His eyes dart toward you with unhinged clarity. \u201cWho dares disturb our family dinner?\u201d he hisses, grabbing a steak knife from his place setting.*\n\nAma steps forward and introduces herself. The elf, looking confused and insane, tells her that he is Eryndor, an Avalon engineer who was tasked with running the magical portals. He said he was left behind and unable to escape with his brethren & has been waiting for their return for thousands of years. \u201d*They said I was a hero! A savior! Yet when their portals closed, who stayed behind to bear the weight of [Avalon](/doc/avalon-7amKaC2AMg)? Me!\u201d* \n\nHe explains he has been keeping the constructs and the leyline energy ready to be used again, if only he had the key to reopen the portals. Ama ensure him they are here to help. He puts his knife down and leads them into a large domed room. In the center is a now familiar sigil etched into the ground - one of the portals of Avalon. Ama tells Eryndor they will prepare the way and that he must hurry off to pack his families things.\n\n# [Valona](/doc/valona-trCwKMhnVy)\n\nAma sets up their Tiny Hut so they can rest. Inside their safe space, Bahruhn contemplates his arcane arm that he brought back from ancient Avalon. He decides it is time to use it.\n\nThe party prepares while Bahruhn meditates. Greyson uses ropey to tie off his arm, and Ramoth draws her [Longsword of the Empire](/doc/longsword-of-the-dragon-empire-WNp5oBATI3). The cut off Bahruhn\u2019s arm and replace it with the arcane artifact. Greyson drinks of the arm\u2019s blood, satisfying his vampiric thirst without harming anyone.\n\nRested and prepared, the party exits their hut and climbs up a ladder into a street under the cool light of the moon. They see that they are now in the [Inner Circle](/doc/inner-circle-iVSnGQFWfT) - the dark waters of the Saltmarsh River flow, separating them from where they just came on an island. Around them are ancient cobbled streets, with gnarled trees with branches twisted together to form natural archways and shadowy paths through this wooded place. Scattered about are large, rusty gears and other mechanical detritus, long overgrown with moss and lichens and succumbing to the ravages of time. Small will o wisps lanterns float around them like fireflies.\n\nThe party sees a small garden with a fountain in the center, an elven statue pouring water into the basin. Around them the trees seem to whisper in elvish and echoes of bells ring on the breeze. They attempt to catch a will o wisp, which struggles like an angry bee.\n\nAma approaches the fountain and drops in a gold coin.\n\nThey hear a harp being plucked melodiously, and from the trees surrounding this place a dryad emerges, calling out a welcome to them in sing-song. The dryad takes a bow, introduces himself as Barnabas, and asks them if they would release the light, which flutters over to the dryad and pulses in time with the harp\u2019s strings.\n\nHe explains to them they have arrived in [Valona](/doc/valona-trCwKMhnVy) - an island that the vampires and their darkness cannot touch - home to the Unseelie fey. If they are looking for help, he advises them to seek out the Lady Nyssara. He takes a bow and disappears into the trees once again.",

They cross the black waters of the moat and enter a desolate courtyard. Examining the guard towers they find no guards, just the machinery of the drawbridge with no obvious mechanism.\n\nThey avoid the front door of the great stone castle and find rusty porticulis standing in tall stone walls to either side of the castle. Ramoth uses Mold Earth to hold up the barricade and the party passes through to the back northeast side of the castle. Seeking shelter from the rain, they enter a low carriage house with sagging roof.\n\nInside they find a familiar carriage: the one they saw Lady Nightshade traveling in. Food is laid out on a candle lit table and it is quiet\u2026 too quiet. The party looks under the carriage and finds a goblin child hiding, whom they bribe with silver. He tells them to be careful of the house\u2019s Lady.\n\n# The Castle\n\nThe party enters through a rusty back door into a servant\u2019s work area. Several skeletons in ragged uniforms go about their eternal chores - sweeping a floor with the nub of a broom, writing something into a desk so many times it \u2018s worn into the surface, stirring a cold pot.\n\nGreyson places a piece of paper under the scribe skeleton\u2019s pen, and it etches out a note:\n\n> *You are cordially invited to the wedding of Lady Nightshade & Knight Amelia\u2026.*\n\nThe party leaves behind the skeletons to their tasks and ascends a staircase into a small servant\u2019s quarters, several beds and wardrobes line the walls along with a large mirror. Ramoth peeks behind the mirror and finds a secret hatch into the wall\u2026. a small wooden ladder leads upwards into the darkness.\n\nThey follow it and emerge many stories above in a great tower.\n\n## The Tower\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=21ec9fe1-f34e-4e09-bfeb-da93a39a6c45)\n\nInside the tower, a narrow spiral staircase winds it\u2019s way around the inner wall, and high above them they see a giant beating heart, glowing red, slowly pumping blood into a fine mist in the tower. They begin to climb the stairs toward it, but a great rumble shakes the entire castle - the stairs begin to wildly undulate and throw most of the party a great distance down to the marble floor. Only Bahruhn manages to hang on, climbing higher despite the tower itself fighting against him. The heart beats faster.\n\nSeveral swords fly out from where they are mounted on the walls, and appearing out of a red mist a party of 5 vampire adventurers materializes through cracks in the stone around them. They attack, and a great and epic battle ensues. The party holds them at bay as Bahruhn attempts to climb higher, but just as he is in range of the great beating heart it lashes out at him with [Chain Lightning](/doc/chain-lightning-nE4DlilDUR). He retreats out a door on the upper platform into the driving rainstorm outside, taking cover from the eldritch magic.\n\nFinally the party puts the last stake in the attacking vampire party. Licking their wounds, they retreat from the base of the tower into a dark hallway covered in cobwebs.\n\n# An Old Friend\n\nAma sets up tiny hut in an old archer\u2019s watch post, the arrow slits overlooking the dreary courtyard they entered from. In the adjacent room, masked in layers of cobwebs, they see a giant coccoon but decide that their condition is too dire to investigate, and they watch it restlessly from their hut\u2019s window as they prepare their spells and share a few healing words.\n\nAfter a restless sleep, they awake to more dark rain clouds outside and they notice the cocoon is\u2026. swaying gently. Not from a breeze, but from whatever is inside.\n\nThey step outside the hut and hear a rhaspy whisper, *\u201dMy old friends\u2026 help me\u2026 please\u2026 help me\u2026.\u201d* Rado immediately recognizes the voice - [Cerric Shadowleaf](/doc/cerric-shadowleaf-jMvCl3ogF1), the ranger who\u2019s conscious made him defect from the [Burle Hunter\u2019s Guild](/doc/burle-hunters-guild-TFqCs3pSJy) and warn the party of the powerful dangers lurking in the wood long ago\u2026\n\nThey decide to open the cocoon with a dagger, and the horrificly mangled body of Cerric climbs out\u2026. he appears to have 4 extra arms grafted onto his torso, some kind of terrible, gruesome experiment.\n\nThis Spider-Cerric climbs the wall and licks his lips hungrily. He attacks, and the party once again defends themselves this time from an attacker who clings to the ceiling above, shooting ensnaring webs. Greyson makes the mistake of throwing in some oil and lighting it on fire, sending the web covered room up into terrible flame and smoke that fills the room, obscuring their view of their attacker who walks the ceiling opportunistically, ensaring Bahruhn. Only after great effort are they able to recover their comrade and defeat this terrible monster who used to be their friend.\n\nThe retreat from this cursed hallway and decide to take the stairway at the base of the tower down\u2026. many levels, into a dark room which appears to be a guard\u2019s outpost.\n\nSearching the ruins and trash, they find the logbook of one of these guards. At first the entries are tidy, noting his rounds and other observations. But flipping further into the book, they find the writing becoming more labored, and many entries about, \u201cCan\u2019t sleep, terrible music every night, haunts my dreams\u2026\u201d\n\nJust as Ama reads this to the party, they hear the ghostly sounds of a great organ echoing through the castle above.\n\n# Castle Dungeon\n\nIn the rooms below, they proceed into a large hall, adorned with elaborate bones on every surface. A table and chair, and candelabara made of skulls is lit with many candles. In each corner of the room is a great pile of skeletons.\n\nSitting at the head of the table is a visage of Lady Nightshade. \u201cWelcome to my home\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have taken something from me - my love - and now you will pay the price yourself. You will become part of something great, your souls for the soul I lost.\"\n\n\u201cA life for a life\u201d\n\nThe party asks questions, but she just responds that the plan is in motion, they will play their part. The time of ascension is near.\n\nShe fades from the room, and the piles of skeletons begin to stir - attacking and throwing their body parts at the party. The hear a banging from the eastern door, \u201cNo! Leave my creations alone!\u201d\n\nDefeating the skeletons, they dare to open the door\u2026\n\nIn the corridor beyond they see the silhouette of a man casting a great shadow down the mist covered hallway. \u201cLeave my bones alone!\u201d He shouts. Emerging from the fog holding a lantern is a tiny man who appears to be part beast, part hunchback.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=92a25309-3ba9-4722-a401-ed05617747fc)\n\nHe introduces himself as Cyrus. \u201cCyrus show you the way, if you follow me. No good out here\u201d Not knowing what else to do the party follows him into a narrow hallway, where a trap is sprung. Porticulis come down around them, trapping them, and the floor gives out. They slide down a slick tube, deeper into the dungeons of the castle as they watch Cyrus spider climb his way up \u201cSawwy, I forgot about trap!\u201d\n\nThe party is deposited with a splash into a flooded jail cell.\n\nRamoth uses Mold Earth to raise the murky ground above the water line, and the party contemplates what to do. Greyson attempts to pick the lock, but drops his tools into the black water. He eventually gets it open and the party exits the watery confines.\n\nIn the cells around them they find skeletons clinging to the bars, and something glittering, glowing beneath the water\u2026. they break into the cell to retrieve it and find a sentient sword bearing the name \u201c[Leshanna](/doc/leshanna-starwhisper-hyyvxrFCai)\u201d\u2026 the mage of old Avalon!\n\nLeaving the dungeons behind, they again trigger another trap and are sucked back into the cell they started in through a pneumatic tube. The commotion causes a lot of noise and they hear from the opposite wing of the dungeon a voice. \u201cIs anyone there?? Please, please help me!\u201d\n\nGreyson approaches the dark cell and sees the pathetic, wet form of a not welcome face: [Saxton Pope](/doc/saxton-pope-CJaIQ4Kkdw), the man who hunted them down in the Hunting Guild\u2019s fell ritual.\n\nGreyson opens the cell door, approaches Saxton, and feeds on him until he dies in his hands. Greyson\u2019s vampire power grows inside him, the malevolence of his deed nurturing his curse.\n\nThe party leaves behind his corpse and ventures further westward through the watterlogged halls, coming to a large flooded room.

      "content": "*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*\n\n\n---\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=667eb3cf-e41d-4e53-a0d7-21be19c67c7d \"right-50 =262x262\")The Stone of Sargoth the Eternal is a glossy, black stone that fits in the palm of your hand. The stone is actually a **vampire aboleth** named Sargoth, transformed by magic into an object.\n\n***Attuned Properties.*** The Stone of Sargoth has the following properties:\n\n* While attuned to the artifact, you can't be charmed or frightened.\n* While attuned to the artifact, all holy water within 10 feet of you turns to blood.\n\n***Legend Lore.*** The Stone of Sargoth has 1 charge and recharges at dawn. While holding the stone, you can expend its charge to cast the *legend lore* spell.\n\nBy using the stone to cast *legend lore*, you communicate directly with the **aboleth**, and it shares its knowledge with you. The aboleth can't lie to you, but the information it provides is often cryptic or vague.\n\n***Failed Memory.*** When your attunement to the Stone of Sargoth ends, you must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you lose all memory of the stone being in your possession and all knowledge imparted by it. A *remove curse* spell cast on you has a 20 percent chance of restoring the lost knowledge and memories, and a *greater restoration* spell does so automatically.\n\n***Sentience.*** The Stone of Sargoth is a sentient lawful evil magic item with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. It can communicate telepathically with the creature that is attuned to it, as long as that creature understands at least one language. In addition, the **aboleth** learns the greatest desires of any creature that communicates telepathically with the stone.\n\nThe Stone of Sargoth hungers for information and prefers not to remain in the clutches of any creature for too long. Whenever the stone desires a new owner, it demands to be given to another intelligent creature as quickly as possible. If its demands are ignored, it tries to take control of its owner (see \"Sentient Magic Items\" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).\n\n***Personality.*** The Stone of Sargoth has an alien intellect that is both domineering and hungry for knowledge. It thinks of itself as an ageless and immortal god.\n\n***Destroying the Stone.*** While in stone form, the **aboleth** isn't a creature and isn't subject to effects that target creatures. The Stone of Sargoth is immune to all damage. Casting an *antipathy/sympathy* spell on the stone destroys it if the antipathy effect is selected and the spell is directed to repel aberrations. When the spell is cast in this way, the stone transforms into mucus and is destroyed, and Sargoth the aboleth appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the stone's remains. The aboleth is incensed by the stone's destruction, and it attacks all other creatures it can see.",

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (`3d6`) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the *remove curse* spell or other magic.\n\n***Dreadful Glare.*** The mummy targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can see the mummy, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened until the end of the mummy's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies (but not mummy lords) for the next 24 hours.\n\n## Mummy\n\nRaised by dark funerary rituals, a mummy shambles from the shrouded stillness of a time-lost temple or tomb. Having been awoken from its rest, it punishes transgressors with the power of its unholy curse.\n\n***Preserved Wrath.*** The long burial rituals that accompany a mummy's entombment help protect its body from rot. In the embalming process, the newly dead creature's organs are removed and placed in special jars, and its corpse is treated with preserving oils, herbs, and wrappings. After the body has been prepared, the corpse is typically wrapped in linen bandages.\n\n***The Will of Dark Gods.*** An undead mummy is created when the priest of a death god or other dark deity ritually imbues a prepared corpse with necromantic magic. The mummy's linen wrappings are inscribed with necromantic markings before the burial ritual concludes with an invocation to darkness. As a mummy endures in undeath, it animates in response to conditions specified by the ritual. Most commonly, a transgression against its tomb, treasures, lands, or former loved ones will cause a mummy to rise.\n\n***The Punished.*** Once deceased, an individual has no say in whether or not its body is made into a mummy. Some mummies were powerful individuals who displeased a high priest or pharaoh, or who committed crimes of treason, adultery, or murder. As punishment, they were cursed with eternal undeath, embalmed, mummified, and sealed away. Other times, mummies acting as tomb guardians are created from slaves put to death specifically to serve a greater purpose.\n\n***Creature of Ritual.*** A mummy obeys the conditions and parameters laid down by the rituals that created it, driven only to punish transgressors. The overwhelming terror that foreshadows a mummy's attack can leave the intended victim paralyzed with fright. In the days following a mummy's touch, a victim's body rots from the outside in, until nothing but dust remains.\n\n***Ending a Mummy's Curse.*** Rare magic can undo or dispel the ritual that gave rise to a mummy, allowing it to truly die. More commonly, a mummy can be sent back to its endless rest by undoing the transgression that caused it to rise. A sacred idol might be replaced in its niche, a stolen treasure could be returned to its tomb, or a temple might be purified of despoiling bloodshed.\n\nMore ephemeral or permanent offenses, such as revealing a secret the mummy wished kept or killing an individual the mummy loved, can't be so easily remedied. In such cases, a mummy might slaughter all the creatures responsible and still not sate its wrath.\n\n***Undead Archives.*** Though they seldom bother to do so, mummies can speak. As a result, some serve as undead repositories of lost lore, and can be consulted by the descendants of those who created them. Powerful individuals sometimes intentionally sequester mummies away for occasional consultation.\n\n***Undead Nature.*** A mummy doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.\n\n*Before opening a sarcophagus, light a torch.*\u2014 X the Mystic's 7th rule of dungeon survival\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Source: MM pave 228\n\n[https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#mummy%5Fmm](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#mummy%5Fmm)\n\n\\\n",

      "content": "## History\n\n### Discovery\n\nW\u00e6rlessh\u00e6th was an island that had been known to dwarves since the founding of [Galmaarden](/doc/new-galmaarden-03tcpxxc2t), if not earlier. The island was deemed by many as too worthless or troublesome to explore despite being reasonably large and only relatively short voyage by boat in distance from Galmaarden. As a result, it was given its name which evolved from early Dwarvish words meaning \u201ca worthless heath.\u201d\\n\\nThough it has been lost to time who the first sailors were to reach the towering cliffs of W\u00e6rlessh\u00e6th as for centuries no dwarf was able to scale its cliffs to reach its soil, it is believed the island was first identified by a dwarf who climbed coastal mountains on the mainlands to the southeast and spotted the landmass poking through the encompassing thick fog.\n\n### Founding of Sturmfreihafen\n\nA few decades before the Incident in Galmaarden, two dwarves involved in the rum smuggling trade, [Sjostein Saltwhisperer](/doc/sjostein-saltwhisperer-MDEMFcPuhW) and Cruckseric \u201cCrux\u201d [Groggut](/doc/groggut-family-FghGxgUfrm), stumbled upon a massive limestone arch in the walls of the island\u2019s coastline leading to a hidden bay with sandy beaches. This discovery was made while the smugglers attempted to flee amongst the fog from Galmaarden crown authority ships. \n\nAfter successfully evading the navy and beaching their vessel, the two dwarves buried a bottle of their finest rum promising to share it the day a permanent port would be established by them as a land of new opportunity. Given the calm weather within the bay compared to the rest of the coast, the dwarf known as Crux named the beach Str\u00fcmfreih\u00e5fen, which evolved to become [Sturmfreihafen](/doc/sturmfreihafen-9imRbQ02Fq) over time. \n\n## Geography\n\nThroughout the entirety of its perimeter, cliffs of limestone 50 feet in height or taller surround the island. These walls give way to coastal caves carved from riptides.\\n\\nKarst pillars ranging in heights from dozens to hundreds of feet in height encircle the island in the surrounding seas which drastically vary in depth, creating harsh waters to navigate when combined with common low hanging fog clouds.\\n\\nThe island is split in two by a range of steep mountains, notable for its 13 major peaks. These mountains are volcanic in origin and are comprised of porous stone known to produce whistling tunes as the wind flows between the gaps in the rock.\\n\\nOn the northeast side of the island, thick rainforest jungles are abundant and a large lake has formed form from rainwater runoff from the central divide. This rainwater seeps into the porous limestone filling aquifers that extend into the east and fill sinkhole pools in the west.\\n\\nIn contrast, the southwest side of the island is significantly drier due to the rain shadow. This half of the island is primarily comprised of a flat plateau with rather nutrient dense but arid soil. Hidden amongst the many coastal karst pillars, an arch of limestone acts as a gate to an isolated bay. The beach of this bay is a mix of red, black and white sand and contains numerous tide pools that around the time of high tide fill with ocean water which warms from natural geothermal heat below as the tides recede. The surrounding bay is crystal clear in the day but glows various bold, prismatic colors at night.\n\n### Locations\n\n* @[Sturmfreihafen](mention://c9867dd0-69f2-478d-8703-0ad133f3f326/document/8a8a0a7f-437f-4005-8007-8fdd78664b85) \n\n\\\n",

After weeks of an unrelenting full moon, it has now vanished, abandoning the night to total darkness. During the day, the sun is blotted out by ominous blue & purple clouds that bring not rain, but a dark dust. In the towns, rumors of the plague and vampire attacks abound - no longer ruled by the strictures of daylight, the blood feeders  have swarmed across the land leaving undead in their wake. But here under the dark canopy of the [Dreadwood](/doc/dreadwood-GcfKdBzGyT), the beasts and outcasts sense that maybe their moment has come.*\n\nEach attendant at tonight\u2019s gathering was visited by a one-eyed raven, claiming to speak for [Mildred Magpie](/doc/mildred-magpie-y6vemFK5Bi), and sharing rumors and news that seemed impossible to believe. But they came.\n\n[halloween rumors.pdf 82466](/api/attachments.redirect?id=b07088da-73ab-46f8-bd36-7af3e7b040b9)\n\n[halloween-rumors (1).json 4103](/api/attachments.redirect?id=8442c844-b629-4cd7-92a1-7b249b6e4d61)\n\n\\\n> *You emerge from the dense foliage of the Dreadwood into a small clearing, the appointed place the one-eyed raven had spoken of.*\\n\\n*Despite the high afternoon hour, a pallid twilight darkens the meadow. Above, ruinous storm clouds churn, blotting the sun. Lightning strikes - not at the ground, but across the sky - a rainbow of colors sparking wild magic across the heavens. The sharp crack of thunder rumbles through the wood, the ground tremors a bit under your boot as it passes, but in the brief moment of light you see sapphire nightshade plants ring the periphery of the meadow, and in the center a large, rusty gear protrudes from the mud like a stage. Several dark figures are hunched near it, murmuring amongst themselves over a low and smoky fire made of bricks of foul smelling peat smoldering against the wet earth.*\n\nThe players introduce themselves, and are chatted up by a small man who appears to be made out of brambles, smoking a pipe and blowing smoke rings. He proclaims himself [King Thistletongue](/doc/king-thistletongue-byqTEswqZE), and partakes in Mama\u2019s stew pot and shares some [black diamond](/doc/black-diamond-pTSDpxQOJ4) with Deirdre (\u201cGot it from the [pirates](/doc/confederacy-of-hearthships-EDksxQvprt)!\u201d. They discuss the rumors they\u2019ve heard.\n\n> Suddenly the air chills and a thin mist creeps into the clearing. In the distance, you hear chanting. The lights of torches appear, their eldritch green light approaching through the wood in solemn procession. You smell something foul, like carrion, in the wind.\\n\\nThe green torches emerge into the clearing, veiled emissaries of a rotten queen - [Mildred Magpie](/doc/mildred-magpie-y6vemFK5Bi), [green hag](/doc/green-hag-VjurXyEBP0), dripping with swamp water and mud, the warts on her face oozing pestilence, her stench overpowering. The ghastly procession proceeds, their voices rising in some ancient tongue you don\u2019t understand, as the veiled coven takes positions around the gear. Mildred slowly levitates toward it, taking a position above you. Lightning cracks behind her, her ominous form black against the sky.\n\nThe crowd turns slowly towards this peculiar creature as she gives a speech:\n\n> \u201dHail and well met, my friends and neighbors. For too long, humanity has encroached on our sacred wood\u2019s borders and it\u2019s heart has been locked away by the leeches who served [the Lady](/doc/lady-nightshade-3kjLNj2Zbs). But now, the [vampire lords](/doc/crimson-court-cofX8ha90z) flee our wood like rats. The human cities burn. Our time is now.\\n\\nAs every beast under these trees knows, nature abhors a vacuum. My darlings, we who have always been here, always called this place home - we will not let outsiders again claim what is rightfully ours.\\n\\nI offer us a new way forward, a contract for the future. Let us unite under a new order, of all the wood together to protect our way of life forever. The Lady is gone, but the ancient [Green King](/doc/the-green-king-7kKoFLFoMK) stirs once again. We must not allow the old ways to return, for they have failed us before\u2026\u201d\n\nAn emissary approaches Mildred with a basket made of brambles, and she lifts out a crying baby.\n\n### \u201cLet us crown us a new prince, one who will serve all of us and the Dreadwood!!!!\u201d\n\n> \u201cHere is my bargain to you tonight: For a party of worthy warriors, I will reveal the location of the Green King. Kill him and bring me [his crown](/doc/green-kings-crown-DJSwQerFVQ). We shall crown the babe [the Yellow Prince](/doc/the-yellow-prince-4B8jQOjWYV), and unite under his banner. Those who survive this task will sit on his council and rule the territories of the Dreadwood in his stead until he comes of age.\\n\\nWho dares to fight for our wood?\u201d\n\nMurmurs spread through the crowd.

Don\u2019t trust them.\u201d* Mildred intones.\n\nThe players board the boat.\n\n# The Old Swamp\n\nThe boat takes the party into a murkier, ancient part of the Dreadwood. The ground gradually gives way to murky water, and the boat\u2019s feet begin to paddle through the muck. The party is on high alert, and they spot two crocodile eyes poking out of the water ahead. Deirdre shoots an arrow at it, and it disappears into the water. Then it resurfaces and attempts to drag",

Discussing their next plans, they hear a splash from the dungeon cells. Going to investigate, they find Jutra wet and trapped in a locked cell. Greyson frees her and rejoins them on the boat.\n\nOutside the boat, an arc of lightning lights up between the two statues of the Lady\u2019s knights, and the great floating hourglass begins to drop it\u2019s sand. The ghostly form of Lady Nightshade appears in the thrones overlooking the sunken room. Above them from the upper halls of the castle, they hear the organ begin to play.\n\n[Lady Nightshade](/doc/lady-nightshade-3kjLNj2Zbs) raises her hand and the current in the room begins to rotate in a great whirlpool. The boat begins turning, and Bahruhn attempts to tie it off. From the depths of the water, undead and rotten human forms emerge, in dripping wet and decaying suits and ball dresses, attempting to board the boat and sink the party. They fight back valiantly. One of the undead attempts to charm them an says, *\u201dSpill your blood on the altar\u2026.\u201d*\n\nAma casts Shatter on the great hourglass, and it breaks into a thousand pieces, glass and sand falling to the mechanical altar beneath it. The ghostly form of Lady Nightshade fades away and the whirpool stops. The party finishes off the undead beasts and emerges dripping from the dark waters onto the upper level.\n\nJutra approaches the altar and cuts their hand, sprinkling blood on it. She dissapears with a -poof- and reappears in some upper level chamber, the storm still brewing outside. A giant wedding cake sits on a table, candles burn in their sconces, and two shadows detach themselves and walk towards a small stage where they begin to play a wedding dirge on a harp and lute. Jutra looks around, wondering where her party is.\n\nBelow the party argues about what to do. They open the 3 doors in the back of this room and find 3 different staircases. Ramoth uses Message to locate Jutra, and relays that she is high above. They choose the staircase that looks the longest and take it up many flights, emerging from a secret door in the ballroom that Jutra is in. \n\nThey cut themselves a slice of cake - delicious. They notice that the figure on top of the cake appears to be [Amelia](/doc/amelia-mAibH1T0Em).\n\n# Wedding Party\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=8dd73d41-b2b0-4549-9fa6-57f932806a8c)\n\n\\\nAs they take in the scene around them, Lady Nightshade appears through the western door, this time in the flesh. \u201cWelcome, I\u2019m so glad you could make it to the wedding. It means a lot to us.\u201d\n\nShe speaks an arcane word and the tempo of the music picks up. Greyson is overcome with [Otto\u2019s Irresistible Dance](/doc/ottos-irresistible-dance-1eIG9URSfq). He waltzes around the room with Lady Nightshade, and she whispers something in his ear and smiles. She then disappears and the shadows become ordinary again.\n\nThe party explores the adjacent rooms. In the western from which Nightshade came, they find a veiled woman\u2019s corpse on a great canopy bed. Bahruhn approaches and lifts the veil and finds that the face has painted to look like Amelia, but appears to be a villager from [Burle](/doc/burle-8ZuZ4qZsXt).\n\nRamoth casts [Augury](/doc/augury-CWWcf6GZTg) beseeching the gods for answers. Should they attack the heart? **WEAL**\n\nIn another adjacent room is a bathtub filled with blood. Greyson approaches for a drink for his vampiric thirst, but it bursts into a spectral form dripping blood, that clings the ceiling screaming.\n\nAma takes a door to the outside and finds herself standing in the rain on the western side of the castle, on the crenulated walkway around the castle\u2019s walls. High above the unmistakable forms of dragons circle above the castle\n\nThe party looks toward the tower that contains the heart, red light pouring from it\u2019s windows. They know now what they must do - destroy it.",

Tiny houses, no larger than acorns, are scattered throughout sprawling groves, each one nestled within the branches or hidden beneath clusters of luminescent fungi that bathe the area in a soft, ethereal glow. The night air is alive with the gentle hum of magic, the faint tinkling of laughter, and the subtle rustle of wings flitting between the foliage. You see [witchlights](/doc/witchlight-sbRt4HC9Ey) dancing through the branches, chasing each other playfully, as tiny figures flit like fireflies along winding paths between the trees, their mirth contagious.*\\n\\n*Suddenly, a group of pixies emerges from a grove, their translucent wings iridescent and catching the colorful glow of the witchlights. They move with graceful, playful energy, their laughter like the sound of plucked harp strings. One pixie, adorned with a crown of dew-kissed petals, flies up to you holding a crystal tray with thimble-sized cups.*\n>\n> \\n*With a warm and melodic voice, the pixie envoy curtsies and then speaks, \"Welcome to Glimmervale, honored guests. We are delighted to have you among us. Please accept these enchanted thimbles\u2014they will grant you the ability to walk among us and experience our world from our perspective. May your time here be filled with joy and wonder.\"*\n\n\\\nAn envoy of faeries greets the party with thimble sized shots of [Diminution](), and they shrink down to the village\u2019s size and are taken in by it\u2019s delights. [Lady Nyssara](/doc/lady-nyssara-J5Xln2dPek) asks for an audience with the leader, [Cazra](/doc/cazra-PMAoY9S4AO), and the faeries oblige her and she excuses herself on unseelie business.\n\nThe party enjoys some of the fey delights in the street market, as they pass fortune tellers and glowing street dancers. They come to a satyr merchant named Merilin who sells them some spell scrolls and other magical items, pointing them to [Dr Flitterwing\u2019s medical office](/doc/dr-flitterwings-medical-office-GSIUxiXmDQ) across the street for human potions.\n\nAfter enjoying some magical cotton candy they knock on Dr. Flitterwing\u2019s door, and seek to buy some healing potions. Greyson seeks to quench his diabolic thirst, and Flitterwing says, \u201cAh yes, in my freezer somewhere, let me look - I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d and disappears into his cold chamber. The party takes the opportunity to look around at his papers and office and they find strange notes in a journal on his desk:\n\n\n:::info\n*Cazra seems very pleased at the progress we are making on the rituals. But when the moon rises each night for the past week ,it is always full, never waning. While I know the work we do here is important and brings comfort to the mortals, I cannot help but notice that the light we put out into the world cannot survive during the day, but only under the cover of darkness. What does it mean for our work that our transformations must now compete with the moon? I am scared to ask Cazra\u2026*\n\n:::\n\nThey examine a strange door in the floor, leading down into a dark tunnel, but again they hear the footsteps and sing song voice of Dr. Flitterwing approaching again and they act naturally, taking the blood vials he offers with thanks.\n\n# The Parade\n\n> *Suddenly, the atmosphere shifts.

The trees around you seem to shimmer, and their branches form into a natural archway above you. The passageway leads to a large opening, surrounded by towering flowers of all kinds. Their scent is overwhelming, the humid air heavy with it. In the center of the clearing, lit up by a moonbeam, is a nymph with translucent skin and flowers woven in her silver hair slowly plucking a harp. Her presence exudes calm authority, and her ancient eyes gaze up at you welcomingly.*\\n\\n*Lady Nyssara is waiting there with her.*\n\n ![Cazra, moon nymph leader of Glimmervale](/api/attachments.redirect?id=ea6cc17b-1fa9-4364-8346-e7eb15e5bdb6)The party tells Cazra of the goings on in Duskmire, and asks for her help and knowledge. She points across the dark waters to the light piercing the night sky, coming from the obsidian [cathedral](/doc/cathedral-of-the-first-vampire-fYVDA6cszh). \u201cThings are changing. The [Knight Amelia](/doc/amelia-mAibH1T0Em) holds vigil, the [Crimson Court](/doc/crimson-court-cofX8ha90z) has been called.\u201d She agrees that the faeries owe them safe passage into the inner circle, but that she will only trade \u201ca truth for a truth\u201d if they wish to know more about the [Inner Circle](/doc/inner-circle-iVSnGQFWfT) of [Lady Nightshade](/doc/lady-nightshade-3kjLNj2Zbs)\u2019s dealings.\n\nThe party thanks her and takes leave.\n\n# 39: The Plan\n\nThe party seeks hospitality at the [Moonlight Mirth Inn](/doc/moonlight-mirth-inn-zzuK7i676b), run by a delightful faerie named [Daisy Dewpetal](/doc/daisy-dewpetal-lqt3e7DgIg), who serves them warm treats made from flowers and cream before escorting them to the upper floor. The party holds court in the sitting room, going over their plans, what should their next move be, how long until the meeting of the [Crimson Court](/doc/crimson-court-cofX8ha90z)? They decide they must strike at the windmill before the Council. \n\nThe look out at across the dark waters from their inn window and see the beam of light bursting from the dark cathedral.\n\nThey next morning, well rested, they meet again with the moon nymph [Cazra](). She summons great dragonflies and supplies the party with potions to return them to their original size.\n\nBefore alighting on their insect steeds, they ask Cazra for a truth. They tell her that [House Talindra](/doc/house-talindra-FszzcwqRUO) is planning something, and that [The Eye](/doc/eye-of-duskmire-zVMHbvUlGR) is holding [Mother Yara](/doc/mother-yara-dawnbringer-4dR2aoAXG6) as some kind of leverage against [Lady Nightshade](/doc/lady-nightshade-3kjLNj2Zbs). Cazra raises her eyebrows but does not seem terribly surprised. \u201cAh, a good one - as promised, what do you wish to know? If I am able, I will tell it truthfully.\u201d\n\nThe party asks what is going on with Doctor Flitterwing? What do the faeries do here?\n\nCazra gestures to the sadly murmuring [witchlights](/doc/witchlight-sbRt4HC9Ey) floating around her. \u201cWe help the human\u2019s souls travel on to their next form\u2026 to spread light into the darkness wherever they go.\u201d\n\nThe parade they saw yesterday and Dr. Flitterwing\u2019s notes take on a new, darker meaning.\n\nThey take the reins of the dragonflies and take off into the night sky.\n\n# Aerial Assault\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=82802952-df03-4df3-be0e-41bad956b622)\n\nAs they coast through the darkness, they see Duskmire down below, and the great swirling gusts of fog that forever hang over the [Dreadwood](/doc/dreadwood-GcfKdBzGyT) beyond the obsidian walls.\n\nThey do a loop high around the Island where the [cathedral](/doc/cathedral-of-the-first-vampire-fYVDA6cszh) is, seeing it in the middle of the Saltmarsh River with two heavily fortified bridges guarding the way to the [Outer Circle](/doc/outer-circle-wpbygPZiuW) and further into the [Inner](/doc/inner-circle-iVSnGQFWfT), where [Castle Nightshade](/doc/castle-nightshade-3ym9ZnkfeF) looms over the city.\n\nAs they take note of the warehouses, the docks with the chained up skeleton stevedores, and the great cathedral with it\u2019s ruptured roof they hear\u2026. flapping in the darkness around them.\n\nGiant [Deep Crows](/doc/deep-crows-R0hImOROoB) lurch and attack at the tasty looking dragonflies with their mounts.\n\nA desperate fight ensues as the party attempts to dodge the attacks of these one-eyed birds, but Bahruhn is grappled and taken in the beak of one. His efforts to fight it off are unsuccessful in his precarious state. Ama dives out of the combat and does a pass by the windmill - seeing several hags throwing [Sapphire Nightshade](/doc/sapphire-nightshade-Qvbjiqksvy) petals into the grinder that turns with the windmill.\n\nOne rushes out the front door and screams at the party, throwing magic futilely into the sky.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=a1ee08a0-e138-43e2-bd4a-961c30f84175)The Deep Crows dart in and out of the darkness, evading attacks by hiding themselves in the moonlight. The party fights back and Greyson lands some epic blows, while Rado readies his wizard-shotgun of ball bearings.\n\nAma flies towards the hag and the windmill with their last few sticks of dynamite. They time it with Rado\u2019s fireball and the whole structure comes tumbling down, in flames and ruins.\n\nTwo smaller hags run out, on fire - screaming. For a second they face the party and look back at them with familiar faces - the lost children from [Burle](/doc/burle-8ZuZ4qZsXt). But they succumb to the flames.\n\nAma casts a [wall of thorns](/doc/wall-of-thorns-wEDoOfhshp), which erupts into flames as well. The hag attempts to run through it and catches alight herself. Bahruhn finally frees himself and commandeers the dragonfly down to deliver the fatal blow, crushing through the hag\u2019s skull.\n\nAs the ruins of the windmill burn, the [Sentinels](/doc/bloodless-sentinels-UAT4Khzzp1) that surround the cathedral do not move or react. The party collects themselves and drops several cat pins - the sign of [House Talindra](/doc/house-talindra-FszzcwqRUO) - amongst the corpses. \n\nSmoke billows up towards the moon, in the distance a siren wails.",

Squatters and junk gangs took hold, looting what was left. Within this state of decay, an arcane explosion devastated the city - leaving behind terrible, eldritch effects and a powerful magical substance known as [delirium](/doc/delirium-JlNwOH9FMQ).*\\n\\n*The explanations for* **The Incident** *vary: a falling star, dwarven sabotage, judgement from the gods, something more terrible? No one really knows.*\n>\n> \\n*Fifteeen years later, Galmaarden is a dismal wasteland contaminated by otherworldly magic and haunted by hideous monsters. Fantastic wealth, lost knowledge, and powerful artifacts lie within the ruins.* \\n\\n*Those who would exploit these treasures organize themselves to take what they can.

The Old Coast Road follows this historic path through the town.\n\nDuring the migration, a terrible monster attack resulted in the massacre of defenseless dwarven travelers, many of them children. In response, the dwarves built a stone wall around the camps and docks by each carrying one stone brick from their home to this port of call. Brick by brick, they built a fortification and a stone monument to those lost in the attack that still stands to this day.\n\nNow, the town has suffered depopulation as the young have left to seek their fortunes elsewhere or the better fishing waters of Saltmarsh to the north. Dwarves still make up the majority of those who live there, and the town is known for turning a blind eye to [Confederate](/doc/confederacy-of-hearthships-EDksxQvprt) pirate activity.\n\n## Map\n\n[https://www.dungeon.church/map/havong/](https://www.dungeon.church/map/havong/)\n\n\n---\n\n* [Procgen Arcana Village Permalink](https://watabou.github.io/village-generator/?seed=823486190&tags=coast%2Chighway%2Cpalisade)\n\n[havong style.json 1349](/api/attachments.redirect?id=2cefb920-5653-4182-9735-0fd273dd899f)\n\n\\\n",

It hops and flutters it\u2019s black wings, silhouetted against the impossibly large full moon. Murder, the crow, holds a small scroll in his gnarled claw.*\n\nAma goes to the window and takes the missive from the crow. It reads:\n\n> *My friends,*\n>\n> \\n*I have been riddled by the cursed brew you left me, it\u2019s secrets were of a much more ancient nature than I expected. Many of the texts that describe this sort of soul magic were destroyed after the fall of the [Dragon Empire](/doc/dragon-empire-odzVqtQPbm), and it\u2019s practice has been forbidden by most orders I am aware of.*\\n\\n*Nevertheless, I have divined that it\u2019s primary reactant is the light of a full moon, under which the [Nightshade](/doc/nightshade-poison-rGISMbm8AA) becomes extremely unstable and unleashes a powerful binding force. My attempts to channel this have been limited, and more research is needed.*\\n\\n-[Caelum](/doc/caelum-the-druid-SHH5bzkRpF)\n\nThey discuss the ramifications of this, what could it mean? Out the windows of the boat, they look up to the full moon, which will not wane, it\u2019s impossibly large face silhouetting the distant spires of [Castle Nightshade](/doc/castle-nightshade-3ym9ZnkfeF) being circled by infernal winged forms. Dragons? \n\nThey decide Greyson, in his vampiric state, should take the lead in their infiltration of the [Crimson Court](/doc/crimson-court-cofX8ha90z). He takes the mask and robe they received from [Lady Nyssara](/doc/lady-nyssara-J5Xln2dPek).\n\nThey steer the boat toward a dock on the shores of the [Inner Circle](/doc/inner-circle-iVSnGQFWfT) and disembark.\n\n# Crimson Court\n\n> *As you follow the obsidian street, your eyes are drawn to the imposing silhouette of the [Crimson Court](/doc/crimson-court-cofX8ha90z)\u2014a towering gothic fortress hewn from red granite, its surface intricately carved with infernal motifs and veins of crimson that seem to pulse with ancient magic. A chill rain begins to fall, the drops hissing into steam as they contact braziers set along the cobbled path casting a deep red hue over the road and building. At the grand, arched iron gate entrance, obsidian statues stand sentry like silent guardians, their glossy surfaces reflecting the rain and the unsettling brilliance of a full moon that looms impossibly large and close overhead, almost as if you could reach out and touch it\u2019s surface. The clatter of hooves on stone passes from behind you, dark carriages, their windows shut against the drizzle, led by the undead skeletal horses with no driver. They slowly wind towards the gate, halting so that the well dressed nobles step down and hurry beneath billowing hoods and umbrellas toward the grand obsidian doorway, red glowing runes in it\u2019s surface*\n\nThe party hangs back and watches as nobles, well dressed but attempting to shelter themselves under umbrellas, step down from their carriages and walk towards the great doors of the Court.\n\nThe party walks past the braziers burning bright and sizzling in the rain, to the Sentinels who stand guard at the door. The runes on the enchanted stone of the Sentinels glows bright red and from their eyes emits a scanning laser, sizing up the party as they approach. They turn towards Greyson, \u201cWelcome Lord - the bell shall toll for the Court to assemble in one hour. Please make your way to the Transformation Chambers then. Your coterie can watch the proceedings from the gallery.\u201d\n\nThe Sentinels push open the doors and the sound of laughter, clinking glasses, and sorrowful piano music wafts from the brightly lit interior.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9oBMwfEr3Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9oBMwfEr3Q)\n\n> *As you step into the antechamber of the Court, a striking scene unfolds before your eyes. A festive crowd of nobles and regal vampire intermingle beneath soaring vaulted ceilings, their voices a soft murmur of laughter and conversation. In the eastern corner, a hooded pianist plays out a hunting melody, surrounded by a small group of appreciative onlookers. Dominating the far western wing is a massive statue of a vampiric knight, its features carved intricately, several nobles standing around it sipping from gold goblets that are being offered by red robed servants, humans who keep their eyes averted down and move silently through the crowd.. The sentinels silently close the door behind you.*\n\n## High Society\n\nThe party looks around the crowd, and catches the eye of [Lady Nyssara](/doc/lady-nyssara-J5Xln2dPek) immediately. She approaches. \u201cGlad you made it.\u201d\n\nShe explains that the Court is neutral ground, and that many have important people have gathered here, but it is impossible to know who is actually one of the Masked Lords on the Court. \u201cI fear tonight is the night we find out what [Lady Nightshade](/doc/lady-nightshade-3kjLNj2Zbs) is planning. We must do whatever we can to stop it. We do not have many allies here - be careful!\u201d\n\nThe party moves around the room and wanders over to the piano player - [Talia Talindra](/doc/talia-talindra-u3RJTStFtn)!! plays a mournful tune to a crowd of people admiring her musicianship. As the party approaches a gnome and a robe-clad druid recoil at their presence, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been properly introduced\u2026\u201d\n\nThe gnome says, \u201cI am Scargiggle, and this is Dalien.\u201d he motions to the druid, who performs a mocking bow. \u201cOur paths cross again. Fortunately for you, it is here in this place of honor.\u201d he flashes a dangerous smile. Lady Talia ends her song to applause from the gathered crowd.\n\nShe pulls back her hood. \u201cYou killed [my son](/doc/jorek-talindra-zwTvrSOGgc). You used my own agents to betray me\u2026 and yet [House Talindr](/doc/house-talindra-FszzcwqRUO)a still stands tall. When this is over\u201d, she nods to Bahruhn, \u201c[your goddess](/doc/sarenrae-W8XCSaoR45) will not be able to outshine what\u2019s next.\u201d\n\nThe two sides stare each other down, before a human servant interrupts to offer glasses of wine from a tray.\n\nThe other members of the party split off to examine the great statue - the plaque reads *[Sargoth the Eternal, First Vampire](/doc/sargoth-the-eternal-9tzjV8CP1Q)*\n\nThey are approached by a bald, badly scarred man who shuffles forward leaning on a cane. He wears an austere black robe, adorned only by a silver symbol of the eye he wears on a necklace around his neck. He turns his crooked smile to the party, as he is followed by an attendant animated [skeleton who carries his skull](/doc/soulbound-skull-DNlBi2UMIZ) in his hands.\n\n\u201cFriends, I am [Velryn Blackthorn](/doc/velryn-blackthorn-bgx7zYW1b0), [Eye of Duskmire](/doc/eye-of-duskmire-zVMHbvUlGR). Your names ring out in the screams of my dungeons - it is always good to see the ambition of the lower classes.\u201d The party starts to realize that everyone here seems to know of them and their adventures. \u201cMaybe soon I can give you a tour of them myself\u2026\u201d he chuckles.\n\nThey turn away from the creepy, scarred man and help themselves to hoer d'oeuvres from a servant\u2019s passing plate. A great fat vampire in a velvet cloak is talking to another charismatic noble\u2026 \u201cBaron Silvertongue, surely the reckless thirst for power by these aristocrats brings ruin upon the blood supply. We must remind the Court that mortal lives are not mere pawns in their deadly games, but a part of our survival as well.\u201d\\nThe man replies, \u201cThere is wisdom in balance, Lord Bloodbane. We must temper Nightshade\u2019s ferver with reason before the damage that has already been done to our mortal charges spreads.\u201d\n\nThe party joins the conversation, agreeing that the Court must agree to stop the bloodshed and the rivalries of the lower estates. The blood must keep flowing after all.\n\n## The Smoking Room\n\n> *As you push open the heavy door to the Smoking Room, a pungent haze of rich tobacco and something darker greets you. The room is dimly lit by flickering, blood-red sconces, casting lurid shadows on the walls. At the far end, behind a long, opulent granite bar, stands a sharply dressed goblin in a tailored suit, his eyes glinting with malevolent amusement. Suspended from ornate iron fixtures along the ceiling, several human captives sway gently, their blood steadily dripping into massive, intricately engraved metallic pitchers beneath them. Nearby, a group of vampire nobles huddle around a worn dice table, the clatter of obsidian dice punctuating their whispers.*\n\nThe party gets a drink from the well mannered goblin, Greyson gladly taking a goblet of blood from the hanging humans. Ama goes over to the table and asks to sit in for a round of dice, and manages to win a round. The vampires around the table are discussing how Talia Talindra \u201cstole from the Eye\u201d an artifact to \u201cprocur Nightshade\u2019s favor\u201d but the group is not sure whether her ambition will lead to her exaltation or her ruin.\n\nThe others examine the room, seeing smoke-stained frescoes of druids assembled in a circle, summoning a great winged dragon. They think back to their time in the [Sunless Temple](/doc/sunless-temple-yS5i3gqWiO). The [Infernal Circle](/doc/the-infernal-circle-8nyqHyTQO2)?\n\nThe party hears a loud *gong* being sounded. It is time for the Court to Assemble.\n\nGreyson takes his mask and cloak that he received from Nyssara and makes his way to the changing rooms. The rest of the party takes\n\n# The Crimson Court\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=f767779d-7b75-41a6-b7cf-a9421fd0f365)\n\n> *As the masked lords gather in the vaulted heart of the Crimson Court, the chamber grows hushed, each robed figure filing to stand in a circle around an altar, the ancient symbols of [Avalon](/doc/avalon-7amKaC2AMg) inscribed in the stone floor. Smoky torches line the walls, filling the air with a haze and ominous red glow over the polished masks and regal robes of the assembled. As the final lord takes their place to complete the circle, an expectant silence fills the room.*\\n\\n*Suddenly, the stillness is shattered as a spectral image materializes in the air above the altar. [Lady Nightshade](/doc/lady-nightshade-3kjLNj2Zbs), her face covered in a veil of mourning, wearing a crown of antlers and the still beating hearts hanging around her neck dripping black blood down the front of her dress.*\\n\\n*\u201dMy lords, our project here together draws towards it\u2019s conclusion. We have suffered to build this place, and have faced attacks from all who do not understand our blood pact. From corners of both the dark and the light our kind has been held back. Yes! Not just [Sarenrae](/doc/sarenrae-W8XCSaoR45), but also [Selune](/doc/selune-wFfmk6l5Ba), have conspired to keep us in our place. With have watched as empires have risen and fallen, as the [rule of the dragons](/doc/dragon-empire-odzVqtQPbm) was replaced by the rule of the miserable mortals. We have boded our time. The moment is now.\u201d*\\n\\n*Her voice grows louder ,ebbing with power, echoing off the walls around you. You hear hushed whispers around you - \u201cAgainst Selune? Blasphemy!\u201d*\\n\\n*\u201dBut I come bearing good news. You have a choice to make. Join me against the gods - or become the price of our ascension.\u201d*\n\nLady Nightshade removes her mourning veil and her face is a rotten and grotesque lich, sunken eyes glowing red with power, long black nails, and skin barely clinging to the frame of her bones. The hearts around her neck beat faster, spilling blood onto the runes carved in the floor.\n\nShe holds out a great black stone before her and whispers in elvish, \u201c*[Sargoth](/doc/sargoth-the-eternal-9tzjV8CP1Q), First Vampire, rightful god of both Day and Night, show us your power!\u201d*\n\nThe room begins to fill with a red mist. The spectral form of Lady Nightshade disappears and the red mist forms into the figure of a great armored vampire, the spitting image of the statue outside, who smiles and bares his teeth. His voice thunders out:\n\n> *MY CHILDREN! I have waited for this moment for millenia. The gods cursed us with what the mortals call vampirism - our fate bound up in their pathetic mortal blood, our domain limited to the night. NO MORE! The hour of reckoning is upon us. What the gods did not know is that within our curse lay the seeds of their destruction. Together, we can destroy them and walk in the full power of our light.*\n\nAt this moment the doors to the Court fly open. Gasps are heard all around. A dark knight, visor down, smoke smelling of burning flesh leaking through the gaps, drags in Talia Talindra bound in chains. \u201cNO! You can\u2019t do this! I\u2019m the one who recovered the stone!\u201d she screams.\n\nSargoth raises his hand and emits a beam of light, enveloping both Talia and the black knight. Talia screams as her skin melts and bones turn to dust crackling in flames. The dark knight is unaffected.\n\n### *NOW MAKE YOUR CHOICE!*\n\nSargoth\u2019s voice echoes around the room.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=a063f7e3-2c8f-4461-8286-ad00fb0edf87)\n\nThe shocked crowd erupts into cries. Some of the masked lords argue for restraint, that to move against the gods spells certain ruin. Others call out to embrace Nightshade\u2019s vision, to cast off the restraints of vampirism. The party joins the argument, urging restraint. They are able to convince a few of the lords, but the Court is evenly split. Seeing their chance, the party attacks those loyal to Nightshade, destroying several vampires in a chaotic melee that sends the others fleeing from the room until only they are standing in the center of the blood soaked altar.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=f64ca02b-7f25-4eb9-83e2-30c7d40818ab)",

The congealed mess of it\u2019s innards slosh around your boots, an overwhelmingly potent mix of human stench, salty bile, and the sharp scent of sour fermentation all roll back and forth rhythmically.\n>\n> You have been here many nights, inside this plodding beast. It continues it\u2019s unending journey south, heaving back and forth, groaning all the way, and you are stuck here for another night in it\u2019s bowels, along for the ride.\n>\n> \\\n> Wizened old hands hold flame to a candle, and it\u2019s light wanly radiates outward, illuminating the face of an ancient looking dwarf. His blind eyes, so cloudy they are almost completely white, twinkle in the candlelight. His bent frame holds up the salt stained sailor\u2019s coat he huddles in, adorned simply with rusty union pins. His strong arms move methodically, the flame revealing layers of memories of tattoos and scars from a long dwarven life lived roughly. He removes a small waxed leather pouch from his coat pocket, and delicately takes out several filthy mementos - a lock of hair bound with twine, a common gem ring, a small piece of granite. He closes his eyes and begins to mutter a prayer in the Dwarven tongue\u2026\n>\n> \\\n> As the words softly tumble from his mouth, he takes a small knife from the pouch and snips a few hairs from his patchy white beard. Holding them to the flame, they sputter and burn in his fingers. He sprinkles the ash over his treasures and opens his sightless eyes, entranced, gazing off into some horizon you cannot see.\n>\n> \\\n> This is not the first night you have witnessed this [ritual](/doc/augury-CWWcf6GZTg), but it is the last. You have been aboard the merchant ship The Grinning Wyrm for who knows how many days, and your [blind dwarf navigator](/doc/moldar-deepbeard-3xYoIqB64Y) says his prayers to [Proteus](/doc/proteus-Apiz4CreFn) every night, supposedly divining the way. And looking out the port window on this black night,  the full moon glimmering of the solstice on the waves, you see the hint of lights on the horizon.\n\n\\\nThe party is in the hull of the merchant ship The Grinning Wyrm, transporting a load of beer barrels from [New Galmaarden](/doc/new-galmaarden-03tcpxxc2t) to [Saltmarsh](/doc/saltmarsh-GkGI6ISio5) for the annual solstice festival. They sit, drinking sub-par beer warm from a tapped barrel, as the crew above debates what to do about an approaching storm.\n\nSuddenly, the dwarf snaps out of his trance and exclaims: \u201c[Proteus](/doc/proteus-Apiz4CreFn) stirs in the deep! Our doom awaits!\u201d\n\nJust as Tharac is about to go up to the deck to investigate, the Dragonborn first mate of the ship [Strezza](/doc/strezza-pvL6kQtaEA) bursts through the deck hatch and screams, \u201cUp you worthless lot! I know you ain\u2019t sailors, but this squall\u2019s a right howler and we may go down if we don\u2019t have all hands on deck! Get to it!\u201d\n\nThe party emerges on the deck to howling winds and battering rain. They begin to attempt to help the crew - lashing things down, bringing down the sails, and securing the lifeboats - mostly unsuccessfully. Deck hands and [mage hands](/doc/mage-hand-1nhwE5UUt3) run amok attempting to right the ship.\n\nThe ship\u2019s captain, a Dragonborn with a large scar across her face and a plumed sailor\u2019s hat named [Grendanna Stormbreaker](/doc/grendanna-stormbreaker-Osm8x5hrwF) puts all her strength into turning the helm. Dax attempts to help, but in the confusion of the storm he pushes against Grendanna in the opposite direction. Tharac has to come over and put all his barbarian might into helping turn the wheel. For a moment it seems as if the ship is saved, but as it crests another large wave it becomes apparent that their collision with the reef is imminent. The Grinning Wyrm crashes into the rocks, throwing most of the party overboard and onto the wet rocks.\n\n# Ambush at the Reef\n\nAs the party collects itself and attempts to make it back onto the broken ship, they notice they are not alone. Sharks and [sahuagin](/doc/sahuagin-MkRLEKcGhh) circle in the waters, eyes glowing red. Through the rain they see an approaching long canoe, at it\u2019s head a sahuagin priestess wields a [spectral trident](/doc/spiritual-weapon-uwpEvKei9A), headed straight for the ship.\n\nThe party attempts to fight them off: Dax with his longbow gets in a couple of good shots, Tharac smacks the hell out of a sahuagin warrior, sending it back into the deep waters, and Krack manages to make one of the approaching monsters [sleep](/doc/sleep-UiiqkwsGAs). But for their trouble they suffer several wounds, and Krack is knocked unconscious as the [sahuagin priestess](/doc/sahuagin-priestess-mKq549Zsqa) boards the ship, eyes glowing with rage as she sets her sights on Captain Stormbreaker. \n\nAs the sahuagin close in, on the horizon a [giant crab](/doc/huge-giant-crab-xNS848hkAw) paddles quickly toward the ship, several [lizardfolk](/doc/lizardfolk-a1lflONBzt) on it\u2019s back. They fire shots at the shark aggressors, and the crab sidles up to the ship. Math notices that some of the sailors are quickly off loading barrels on to the back of the crab, as the lizards strap them down to make a quick getaway.\n\nOne of the sailors, out of desperation, breaks open a barrel that\u2019s being unloaded by the lizards, revealing many wax-covered cylinders. Quickly breaking the seal and reading the scroll, it erupts into flame and shoots out a [fireball](/doc/fireball-aT1QnILXxQ). Unfortunately, it quickly fizzles in the rain before finding it\u2019s target.\n\nThe ship begins to break apart and the sailors begin to abandon ship, either taking their chances swimming into the dark waters or grabbing on to debris or one of the overloaded lifeboats. The party also makes their move, grabbing a lifeboat that their friend the blind navigator is already sitting in patiently waiting. He intones: \u201cAye I told you it was coming.\u201d Looking back, the party sees Grendanna saluting them as she goes down with the ship. Krack creates a light to lead their small dinghy through the storm, which breaks as soon as the sahuagin slink back into the deep. They row towards Saltmarsh.\n\n# Welcome to Saltmarsh\n\nThe town of Saltmarsh is alive with sound of partying, revelry, fireworks, and games. The docks swarm with busy fishermen & longshorewomen, unloading the day\u2019s catch from the boats to be salted or sent to hungry crowds in town. No one particularly notices the soggy crew that arrives on a tiny dinghy.\n\nDax suggests that the party check out a sailor bar of ill repute he\u2019s heard of: [The Empty Net](/doc/the-empty-net-NwapU8Z8Za).\n\nThe party makes it\u2019s way through the town, the market green set up with traveling merchant caravans hawking their wares. The party indulges in buying sketchy raffle tickets, some mediocre artisanal coffee, getting a drunk tarot reading, and sees an extremely tall wizard leading a gaggle of town children who cheer after him, \u201c[Keledek,](/doc/keledek-the-wizard-jGCH5H0n7q) Keledek, he\u2019s the best!\u201d As he shoots fireworks from his fingertips.\n\nCrossing the [Sharkfin Bridge](/doc/sharkfin-bridge-9DQ0Qs7x2p) across the brackish river that runs through town, Krack momentarily feels nauseous. The feeling passes as soon as she steps off the other side.\n\nPassing through the crowds of revelers towards The Empty Net, the party passes by a large table set with a cornucopia of foods to feast on. At the head of this table sits 5 people, all a little sloshed, apparently holding an open air court before a large crowd of amused gossipers.\n\nThe party overhears that this is the [Saltmarsh Council](/doc/saltmarsh-council-8KxfpMfTQ0). Behind them sits a giant hay sculpture of a crab holding a moon up, in honor of [Selune](/doc/selune-wFfmk6l5Ba) and the solstice. A dapper gentleman with a finely manicured beard and very fancy clothes stands up to give a slightly slurred speech: giving thanks for the solstice harvest and wishing his fellow council members good luck and good health. He introduces them for the benefit of any travelers: himself, [Gellan Primewater](/doc/gellan-primewater-P10FbIiWH1); [Anders](/doc/anders-solmor-njTKn6ITMV), the young, blonde ship master; [Eda Oweland](/doc/eda-oweland-HEslJp2L08), a gruff woman who clearly is the head of this court; the peg legged gladiator who leads the Town Guard, [Eliander Fireborn](/doc/eliander-fireborn-GSljW693Ga); and a disinterested female dwarf, [Manistrad Copperlocks](/doc/manistrad-copperlocks-W9uyiYutrl), who has recently arrived to take charge of excavating the [old dwarven mine](/doc/the-old-mine-ndIfgvk1B6).\n\nTwo young boys approach, bringing before the court their petition: one has stolen the ball of the other. Two farmers, obviously friends, bring a minor dispute over fence mending. More seriously, someone mentions that the strange goings on at the abandoned house south of town have gotten even stranger lately: strange noises, strange lights, strange shit. Isn\u2019t it time the esteemed Eliander turned his guards out to clear it once and for all? Eliander agrees to post a bounty, and emphasizes his commitment to bringing law & order to the people of Saltmarsh.\n\nWhile the townspeople air their grievances and laugh amongst themselves, Krack uses her mage hand to expertly lift a purse.\n\n# The Empty Net\n\nThe soggy party continues to the diviest bar in town, where several sailors are relieving themselves of their stomach contents outside. They enter the dilapidated bar, which hangs out precariously over the water on a series of stilts, and the whole place appears to be haphazardly assembled out of random boat parts, crab traps, and held together with rope.\n\n ![Kreb Shenker, proprietor of the Empty Net](/api/attachments.redirect?id=8e6711bb-805a-484c-9c4e-9e421d3459ac)Approaching the barkeep, a bald man named [Kreb Shenker](/doc/kreb-shenker-ya5uvzqUn9) with a large dagger who chews a cigar serves them with the only shitty beer they have. Chatting up the patrons, they meet a sailor [Caspian](/doc/caspian-the-motherless-cNaoIg05cn) who trades small talk about ships coming and going and many \u2018your mom\u2019 insults.\n\nThe party notices a dice game going on at a table in the corner. They join in to play a few rounds, talking with the sailors who tell them that recently a young messenger came through trying to pay his gambling debts with books he claimed were pilfered from the abandoned house south of town, apparently the old residence of a reclusive alchemist. One of the sailors commented that when he was out \u201ccrabbing\u201d in the area, he saw the windows lit up with strange spectral lights.\n\n# Exploring the Town\n\nThe party tires of the drunk morons who inhabit this bar, and goes back out on to the street, searching for a place to sleep tonight. They stop again at the Council\u2019s solstice court, and Math tries to win the attention of Eliander, whom he recognizes from Striborg. He asks if there is any way the party can contribute to the town, and Eliander informs that if he wishes to make a name for himself, he should come by [Hoolwatch Tower](/doc/hoolwatch-tower-zE9TFrxl35) in the morning for more information on the hobgoblin problem the party heard about earlier. He also comments that the [Iron Riders](/doc/iron-riders-of-abraxas-P77pTaxjou) are always looking for young upstarts with a taste for adventure.\n\nAcross the way is the [Sailor\u2019s Temple](/doc/saltmarsh-sailors-temple-0uvkMI2jn9), lit up with candles. The party decides to see if they can rest here for the night. A ceremony for the dead lost at sea is taking place, led by an older, frail dwarf named [Ettria](/doc/ettria-fuNZjqM9yB), who implores them to light a candle for their lost [captain](/doc/grendanna-stormbreaker-Osm8x5hrwF). After making a donation, Ettria leads them to the rectory where the party sleeps on austere stone beds.\n\nIn the morning, the town is subdued but some activity is taking place down at the docks. The party makes the trek down the road to the Hoolwatch Tower, an armory that sits at the top of a defensible hill. Two silent and unmoving guards stand outside, they do not deviate from their duties when the party attempts to question them. It\u2019s apparent that Eliander is not here, and that what he meant was that the party should check the bounty board that hangs outside:\n\n> * 100g - Smuggling Tips \\[old and weathered script\\]\n> * 50g - Each Troll Head\n> * 200g - Information leading to the identification of the body found at the Hunter\u2019s Shack In [Burle](/doc/burle-8ZuZ4qZsXt)\n> * 200g - Clean out Abandoned House South of Town\n> * 100g - Eradicate Hobgoblin Cultists \\[hastily scribbled at the bottom in an uneven hand\\]\n\nDisappointed that they could not get an audience with Eliander, or a reaction from the guards, the party continues around the bend to the nicer tavern in town - [The Wicker Goat](/doc/the-wicker-goat-695vZZb5G4). The handsome two story tavern has rooms for rent above a large dining hall. Outside several Iron Riders water their armored horses, their steeds weighed down by large mailbags. Inside are many members of the Town Guard and dwarves obviously bound for the mining project, their pickaxes and headlamps strapped to their packs.\n\nThe friendly barkeep, [Lankus Kurrid](/doc/lankus-kurrid-Fp2Q3VBXoV), an older gentleman with the measured movements and even attitude of someone who spent many years in military service, serves beer and breakfast. He welcomes the party\u2019s questions about the area, telling them of the gossip he hears from the guards and other travelers who pass through his establishment. They learn that there are no (safe) roads to New Galmaarden, that the townspeople are generally superstitious and he doesn\u2019t put much stock in stories of haunted houses or hobgoblins riding goats in the night, and that the \u201cbody\u201d found near Burle was only a skull, discovered inside a hut made of bones and teeth (Captain Eliander is very interested in this, apparently).\n\n\\\nAfter some discussion, the party decides they would like to seek out the bounty for clearing out the haunted house\u2026..\n\n\\\n",

They turn back and Ama feels drawn to sleep in the tomb of [Barnaby Oweland](/doc/sebastian-barnaby-oweland-c5f2wjsPvu). A great worm erupts from the depths of the sarcophagus and attempts to swallow Bahruhn. Ama uses her skills in Animal Friendship to send the beastly centipede back to the depths below the tomb.  \n\nRamoth listens to the esoteric whisperings of the beating heart she carries: *Give your life to the Lady and you\u2019ll be free forever!* \n\n# Illusion\n\nTrying the other direction, the party finds a table set with a feast. Having encountered a similar underground meal before, they are skeptical, and Rado determines it is an illusion. As the image fades they find an eviscerated body on the table, it\u2019s chest open and exposed, with the heart missing. Each place setting is covered in blood. A small closet to the east contains nothing but snakes.\n\n# Cultist Quarters\n\nFurther into the dungeon, the party is ambushed by ghosts wearing chains with bleeding abscesses where their hearts should be. The fiends scream in pain and cry out as they attack.\n\nIn the passages to the west, the party finds evidence of Amelia\u2019s cult. Several small bunks are in alcoves here, one inscribed with graffiti on the wall: *[LUKAS](/doc/lukas-woodenkeeper-MFwbJrVzOB) WUZ HERE.* A couple of boxes of rotten Nightshade flowers are stacked against the walls. Ama explores a well in the center of the room and discovers that it is filled with blood.\n\nA large map of the [Saltmarsh](/doc/saltmarsh-GkGI6ISio5) area hangs near a table. It shows a city called [Duskmire](/doc/duskmire-hJey19lfsu) upstream from Saltmarsh, and \u201cLizardfolk Colony\u201d marked north on the coast.\n\nThe group decides that this is as good of a place to rest as any, and take turns sleeping shifts. Bahruhn wakes from his slumber and shares his vision of riding a gondola through a flooded street, a city with a large looming windmill houses with no doors. The group is decidedly refreshed and gathers up their courage to continue into the depths of this house of horrors. Bahruhn grabs a finger from the eviscerated body as he passes back through the cursed feast hall.\n\n# The Heart of the Matter\n\nThe party finds a large staircase descending into the darkness below. In a large chamber with a vaulted ceiling, they find reliquaries carefully arranged: an ivory comb, a lock of black hair, the bones of a child, a small pouch made of flesh. Ama is drawn to a teddy bear made of dried flesh, as she steps forward to touch it the party tries to persuade her to leave it alone. She reluctantly complies.\n\nThe loud thump-thump of a heartbeat echoes through this chamber, emanating from the south\u2026 the party follows their beating heart like a compass.\n\nThis large chamber is filled with a large pool of churning blood. As the party enters the blood forms into 3 humanoid figures, each someone the party recognizes: [Eldan Fletcher,](/doc/eldan-fletcher-QWyA10eG7I) [Meepo](/doc/meepo-UMrKyHk53I), and [Lukas](/doc/lukas-woodenkeeper-MFwbJrVzOB) Woodenkeeper. They call out for the party to \u201csubmit, join us, be born again in the lady\u2019s blood\u201d. As Bahruhn comes under the spell, a terrible and magnificent worm with tentacles and many rows of teeth emerges from the gore. It turns its large eye to the party and for a second they see a vision: a vast void, the formation of worlds, the beginning of the great [cycle of time](/doc/session-01-ouroboros-turns-MlX7v5L4dN), the tear in the material realm that [unleashed the dragons](/doc/the-infernal-circle-8nyqHyTQO2), the spread of humanity over the earth\u2019s surface, their own lives intertwined with the eternal. As they gaze into the void of the creature\u2019s soul, they each come face to face with their own ambition. Bahruhn calls on the power of his goddess to free himself from the creature\u2019s thrall, and reenters the fight. \n\nThe great creature and the blood minions attack, attempting to draw the party into the blood. Attacking the great worm directly covers them in mucus - Greyson finds himself unable to breathe except underwater. Ramoth is hit by the acidic goo and suffers the effects of a disease that causes her skin to burn unless she is kept wet. The situation is desperate, the party attempts to get out of the miasma but great waves of blood draw them back in.\n\nRado casts Cursed Creature, holding back the horrific beast for a few moments. Ama steps forward and uses the creature\u2019s confusion to cast Hypnotic Pattern, leaving the worm dumbstruck by a dazzling illusion. \n\nThe blood begins to violently swirl in the chamber, creating a whirlpool which draws Ramoth under the bloody churn.

I felt nothing - I was nothing. I became one with the emptiness and time washed over me - unworthy and alone. \n\nThere was no way to know how long I was like this, separated from both my body and my mind. Days? Years? Centuries? I still do not know.\n\nUntil one day my purgatory was broken by a pulsing light. At first I thought it was the death of one of the countless stars around me, their cruel, cold light always out of reach, but it grew closer and closer until I felt it\u2019s warm rays on my feathers. For the first time in - *I don\u2019t know how long!* - I felt a tingling sensation. First in my fingers, then in my chest. My heart beat in time with it\u2019s glimmering. Was this the end of my exile, or the beginning?\n\nI set my feet down on the cold rock of a meteor speeding through space. The light grew brighter - I heard it whisper my name \u201c*Sylas\u2026. At last I have found you\u2026\u201d*\n\nI crawled on hands and knees across the rock towards it. My Queen? Had she been searching for me all this time?\n\nWithin a crevice of the meteor, I found the light\u2019s source. A radiant orb swirling with it\u2019s own inner cosmos, it\u2019s surface as smooth as glass, warm to the touch. It whispered to me in languages I did not understand.\n\nOn my rock, I assembled a small cabin from space trash. I built an altar for my orb and I devoted every waking moment to mimicking the things it spoke to me, each repetition bringing a small sliver of meaning. \n\nI came to understand that I was being tested. I was not in exile. I was on a mission: to bring glory and power to my Queen so that I could return to her grace. I would not fail her.\n\nAs my rock hurtled toward Pyora I clutched the orb close, knowing my adventure had only just begun.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=fa786dd9-95e7-4f52-a730-d810f0791748)\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=8b4007a7-8c67-43af-8362-5a67eb147f52)\n\n### Level 3 Sheet\n\nFor IRL one shot:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1whDUlIbosl%5FavCCsm3ZfRUmDpdDGmJyu/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1whDUlIbosl%5FavCCsm3ZfRUmDpdDGmJyu/view?usp=sharing)\n\n[Sylas_Level3.pdf 470849](/api/attachments.redirect?id=234818d2-58b5-4acb-b7ec-94122305a319)\n\nSpell List / Cards:\n\n[spells-sublist-Sylas Starfeather Level 3.json 693](/api/attachments.redirect?id=87eac4b4-7813-47a9-9d6a-b40512cfbaaa)\n\n[sylas-level3-rpg_cards.json 14195](/api/attachments.redirect?id=6345ea6c-ad23-4909-b243-eedd49244911)\n\n[sylas-level3-spellcards.pdf 103915](/api/attachments.redirect?id=00123102-2ce7-45d3-b4cf-d54ac9a3aaf8)\n\n\\\n",

      "content": "# Arkwrights Guild\n\n## History\n\nThe **Arkwrights Guild** is a preeminent organization within the dwarven kingdom of [Durandar](/doc/durandar-sWDxZHDVIC), deeply rooted in it\u2019s history and culture. Its origin can be traced back to the great dwarven migration led by the visionary shipbuilder and captain, [Thrain Stoneflower](/doc/thrain-stonehelm-mjPtuvzNNT). Under his leadership, the arkwrights built the great ships that carried the dwarves to their new home in the west.\n\nAfter the settling of Durandar, Thrain Stoneflower became an advocate to preserve not only the dwarven culture but also the natural world in the face of the apocalyptic visions of the [Prophet-King Olfgard Wisebeard](/doc/king-olfgard-wisebeard-S0YDu9xGHy). Stoneflower envisioned an organization that would safeguard life in all its forms, ensuring not just the continuation of the dwarven race, but all life in Pyora.\n\nUnder his guidance, the Arkwrights Guild was founded, bringing together experts from various fields - including shipbuilding, [druidic arts](/doc/druid-f55fJLA6Pt), [rangers](/doc/ranger-XP204Jw7m7), and [alchemy](/doc/artificer-CUcddlp3hZ). This unique blend of expertise allowed the guild to fulfill its mission of archiving biodiversity and defending natural life.\n\n## Organization\n\nThe Arkwrights Guild is organized into specialized branches, each responsible for preserving a specific aspect of biodiversity. These branches include:\n\n* **Ark Artificers**: Artificers and other engineers who design and maintain underground ecosystems (\u201carks\u201d) for living specimens.\n* **Flora Curators**: Druids and botanists responsible for underground gardens and operating the Arkwright seed banks.\n* **Fauna Wardens**: Rangers and other adventurers responsible for field work and capturing specimens in the wild. Often used in \u201cspecial operations\u201d authorized directly by the King of [Durandar](/doc/durandar-sWDxZHDVIC).\n\nAt the helm of the guild is the esteemed **Grand Archivist**, who oversees all operations, represents the guild in political matters in the Dwarf Council to the King, and ensures the continuity of its mission. Thrain Stoneflower was the first Grand Archivist.\n\n## Current Role\n\nThe Arkwrights Guild plays a multifaceted role in dwarven society and within the kingdom of Durandar:\n\n* **Custodians of Knowledge**: The guild maintains extensive archives, seed banks, documenting information on species, ecosystems, and alchemical practices.\n* **Political Advisers**: The Grand Archivist holds a prominent position within the Dwarven Council, providing valuable insights into ecological matters and their relevance to the kingdom's policies.\n* **Contributors to Craftsmanship**: Arkwrights contribute to Durandar's renowned craftsmanship by providing unique materials sourced from underground arks, used in the creation of highly sought-after goods.\n* **Guardians of Durandar's Future**: The Arkwrights view themselves as the keepers of Durandar's future and prophetic legacy.\n\n## Heraldry\n\nThe symbol of the Arkwrights Guild is a blooming flower set inside a ship navigator\u2019s wheel. They use a dark green color in their heraldry and flags.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=9ffaca03-4bd5-4006-8bec-20fa68b12416)",

His ancestors were master brewers, known across the land for their unparalleled expertise in crafting the finest intoxicants of equally bold flavor and strength.\n\nCraggy may be a dwarf of the old ways, but his heart is as warm and welcoming as the finest mug of grog. With a hammer in one hand and a brewing kettle in the other, he searches for the missing pieces of his past \u2014 and a future where the Groggut name will again be celebrated in the ancient halls of Galmaarden.\n\nAs a young dwarf, Craggy grew up far from the decaying ruins of his ancestral homeland, in a sunny coastal trade town of the name [Sturmfreihafen](/doc/sturmfreihafen-9imRbQ02Fq). There, his family continued their brewing legacy by crafting a popular local grog which from they then accrued a modest fortune by selling to sailors, merchants, and travelers. The Groggut family quickly became known for their exceptional blends, and Craggy, with his sturdy build and jovial nature, grew fond of the trade. He spent many years learning the art of brewing and forging connections with traders and adventurers who passed through the port.\n\nBut as the years passed, Craggy could never shake the call of his ancient heritage. After hearing rumors of the [Incident](/doc/delirium-JlNwOH9FMQ) in his ancestral homeland and Galmaarden\u2019s attempts at rebuilding the once proud city, he felt a deep yearning to return to his familial tree\u2019s roots. Craggy then decided that at the next opportunity presented, he would leave behind the comfort of the idyllic coastal town and set out on a long and perilous journey, determined to find any trace of his ancestors and restore the family name to the halls of Galmaarden.\n\nOne day while tending to his family\u2019s brewing business, said opportunity arrived. Craggy overheard a group of seasoned merchant traders discussing a lucrative expedition to the remnants of Galmaarden, seeking rare artifacts, salvageable goods, and perhaps a glimpse of the lost dwarven city's hidden secrets. Intrigued by the opportunity to reconnect with his ancestral homeland and eager to secure the future of his family\u2019s brewing legacy, Craggy approached the group with an offer they couldn\u2019t refuse: his skill at brewing hearty drinks that would keep the crew \u201crefreshed\u201d during their long voyage.\n\nThe leader of the merchant group, a grizzled sailor named [Sjostein Saltwhisperer](/doc/sjostein-saltwhisperer-MDEMFcPuhW), saw value in Craggy\u2019s talents, both as a deckhand and a source of morale for the journey ahead. Soon, Craggy was sworn in as a trusted member of the crew, his role extending beyond just a trader to a valuable asset on this perilous journey to the lost city. With his trusty brewing tools packed, Craggy set sail, ready to face the unknown dangers of the open sea and the forsaken ruins of Galmaarden, hoping to reclaim his ancestors' legacy and restart his family\u2019s brewery in the heart of the dwarven homeland.\n\nWhen Craggy arrived with the [Saltwhispers Trading Company](/doc/saltwhispers-trading-company-NYN8gvys1m), upon the lands surrounding Galmaarden what he discovered was a city vastly different than what he had been described in his childhood bedtime stories, a chaotic land filled with danger. Yet, Craggy's determination burned brighter than ever. He vowed to himself that he would rebuild his family's brewing reputation in Galmaarden from the ground up, honoring the legacy of those who came before him, even if it meant facing potential threats of the wastelands that now surround his ancestors\u2019 lands.\n\nSometime later during an artifact-hunting expedition led by Sjostein through the desolate wastelands of Galmaarden, Craggy and the crew ventured deep into the heart of the ruined city, seeking remnants of ancient dwarven relics. At some point on the quest, Craggy collapsed, unconscious as a burst energy flooded his body, leaving him in a state of semi-consciousness for what felt like an eternity. Little does Craggy remember from this day beyond the moment he entered a decrepit stone building once controlled long ago by the Kingdom of Durander.\n\nWhen Craggy finally awoke after an unknown period of time, the world around him seemed\u2026 different. Tints of varying shades skewed his vision. His sunkissed skin, now had veins of deep purple snaking across his limbs. An unfamiliar weight seemed to press against his bones, and he could feel that his tendons were now intertwined with something strange\u2014something unnatural, and his body was slowly transmuting, becoming harder, more crystalline in places, as if some part of him was turning to stone or metal.\n\nOver the next few cycles of the moon, Craggy began to notice changes beyond physical. He soon developed sorcerous powers as if magic was coursing through his veins. Originally foreign to him, Craggy was initially alarmed to his abilities which he had no understanding of, but as time passed he slowly developed capabilities to control this strange magic: learning to transmute the flavors of drinks, charm unexpecting strangers, and eventually shoot partially controlled bolts of energy from the tips of his fingers.\n\nAlthough he was raised in lands outside of the reach of [Durander](/doc/durandar-sWDxZHDVIC) rule, Craggy was still aware that magic was still considered to be a sinful act within many dwarven circles, and thus he attempted to \u2014 at the best of his limited abilities \u2014 to keep his powers secretive amongst those he did not trust. Now equally terrified, excited, and confused, Craggy realized that this ominous transformation would shape not just his destiny but his very identity, as he seeks out to comprehend what exactly has become of both him and the city of New Galmaarden.\n\n## Personal Quests\n\n* Find evidence of his family\u2019s history in [Galmaarden](/doc/new-galmaarden-03tcpxxc2t) related to the ancient brewing traditions and dwarven historical events (such as the Short Wars, Great Migration, and Incident) as well as any remaining survivors of his family, pre-dating the Groggut surname, who never left the city.\n* Discover what caused his sorcerous powers and how he can learn to control them.\n* Find if [Sjostein](/doc/sjostein-saltwhisperer-MDEMFcPuhW) or anyone from the [Saltwhispers Trading Co](/doc/saltwhispers-trading-company-NYN8gvys1m) is still alive.\n* Develop connections to the brewing industry of Galmaarden.\n* Discover new ingredients for his own unique blend of grog.\n\n\\\n",

Or is it deliberately crafting a new personality for yourself to perfectly both contrast *and* match the new micro-society you\u2019ll be joining?\n\nJethro believes it\u2019s the latter.\n\n\\\nJethro Honeyrock has travelled far and wide, not truly finding a place to settle down. From sneaking in and staying at a forgotten bedroom at an inn, to making makeshift shelters to scrape by in hidden alleyways. He's been sure to not get too tied down to one place or another, as when he'd run a gambling grift and be found out, he'd skip town. If he found himself with a bit of a gambling debt on his head, he'd also skip town.\n\nHe's a good bit shorter than the average dwarf, with a noticeably scrawnier stature, too. He hides it well, however, typically wearing a large, baggy cloak over his regular doubled-up garb to look bulkier than normal. When he'd skip town, he'd reinvent his appearance the best he can while still trying to look dwarf-like, from changing up his intricate beard braids, swapping out his entire wardrobe, to making more rash decisions such as intentionally giving himself a scar on his face when fleeing an especially bad situation.\n\nJethro's gambling related activities have slowed down after his most recent gambling run. For months, he played and cheated in an underground game run by [The Queen's Men](/doc/the-queens-men-xaYgpxxPXi), but eventually his gambling grift went sideways. He found himself losing a lot of the money he had earned, specifically to a dwarf named [Bhardok](/doc/bhardok-the-underlord-Eqst7sfdWd). When he somehow started to lose more than he won in a game rigged *in his* favor, Jethro started to get antsy and look for a way out.\n\n\\\n",

In the distance, from the [Inner Circle](/doc/inner-circle-iVSnGQFWfT), a siren is raised like a wolf\u2019s howl. The towering [cathedral](/doc/cathedral-of-the-first-vampire-fYVDA6cszh) stands grimly before you, it\u2019s shattered spires and broken stained glass giving it a solemn, ancient majesty. A spire of pure white light erupts from it\u2019s roof towards the heaven, as if reaching for the moon above. Around this unholy chapel unmoving [sentinels](/doc/bloodless-sentinels-UAT4Khzzp1) keep vigil - silent, unyielding - the light of the flames flickering off their smooth obsidian forms. To the west, lights begin to come in the warehouses, as the siren rouses people to action.*\n\nThe party gathers themselves, and notes that the sentinels haven\u2019t moved. Greyson notices that instead of guarding the bridges from people coming in, they are silently facing inward\u2026 like they\u2019re guarding a prison.\n\nAma scries into the cathedral, and sees a veiled Amelia praying at the altar, the column of light erupting from the now familiar rune portals of ancient [Avalon](/doc/avalon-7amKaC2AMg). \n\nBahruhn takes his enlarged dragonfly up to the roof, hid by Ramoth\u2019s Silent Image to blend into the smoke.\n\nRamoth summons her owl familiar and sends it up above the smoky haze of the ruined windmill. They see that the docks are mostly unattended, save for some skeletal stevedores chained to their workplaces. The black waters of the Saltmarsh River look foreboding. \n\nThen:\n\n> *The distant clatter of hooves and the low, resonant hum of dark magic ripples through the night.

The [Sentinels](/doc/bloodless-sentinels-UAT4Khzzp1) part silently, as the clattering of hooves on stone echo across the courtyard.*\\n\\n*Two riders appear atop these undead steeds - one, a black knight with visor pulled over his face, smoke pouring from every crack and orifice in his gleaming armor. The smell of burning flesh wafts toward you.*\\n\\n*Beside him rides a woman of mesmerizing beauty and regal darkness - her red air adorned with a crown of thorns. Around her an aura of dark magic ripples through the night, her eyes glinting with cold resolve in the moonlight. But her beauty carries with it foreboding, for around her neck is a necklace of beating hearts, blood cascading darkly down the front of her white dress. [LADY NIGHTSHADE](/doc/lady-nightshade-3kjLNj2Zbs)!*\\n\\n*She dismounts, and her steed crumbles into a pile of ordinary bones with a clatter on the pavement. The smoky knight stands at attention atop his horse, hand on the hilt of his sword as he watches the Lady walk towards the door of the Cathedral.*\n\nAma hides behind a pillar, using scrying to listen in on the cathedral. The others use Message to attempt to make a plan with this new development.\n\n> **NIGHTSHADE:** \"You have done well, my love.

The final reckoning is upon us, and none shall stand in our way.\"\n\nNightshade - or her astral projected form - fades into nothingness as her voice echoes around the black cathedral.\n\nAt this moment, the players decide to strike. Rado embues Ramoth\u2019s familiar with [Stone Shape](/doc/stone-shape-Ni4NXltKR3), and they send it up to the roof, past Bahruhn, and down into the beam of light that erupts from the cathedral\u2019s roof. The owl flies down and touches the rune on the stone floor, defacing it\u2019s magical surface.\n\nThe light goes out.\n\nThe sentinels freeze, their magic going dark.\n\nIn the darkness, they hear Amelia laugh.\n\nThe doors to the cathedral fly open and she walks out into the open, flanked by two hooded vampire acolytes.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=3bccf9e9-0755-4098-9d5a-19d89c9f2bdf)\n\n# Final Confrontation\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leJ-kA9IV5c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leJ-kA9IV5c)\n\n[Amelia](/doc/amelia-mAibH1T0Em) calls out, \u201cGive your souls to me or watch the world perish!!\u201d\n\nAn epic battle ensues in the courtyard of the cathedral.\n\nThe vampire acolytes spider climb up to the roof, engaging Ramoth and the others.\n\nRamoth answers, \u201cWe will defeat you and save the world!!\u201d and summons her air elemental.\n\nAs Rado launches his magical assaults, Amelia answers with [Feeble Mind](/doc/feeblemind-AIswvEh2kI), and he finds himself unable to read his spells.\n\nAmelia calls to [Barnaby](/doc/sebastian-barnaby-oweland-c5f2wjsPvu)\u2019s soul, merged inside Ama, \u201cMy son, Kill yourself - throw yourself from the pillar\u201d but Ama pushes Barnaby back and resists.\n\nBahruhn fells one of the vampires, and it explodes in a cloud of gore in his face.

When the children get agitated, Craggy kills them, and they escape hearing demonic screaming from within.\n\nFurther down the road they find @[Garmyr](mention://57547bfc-c1d7-4731-b345-b35ab0321bb6/document/e0c74cd1-7bf6-4f6b-8931-58302c65e177) barricading a large temple, it\u2019s stained glass windows glowing from within.

They offer the party some [Velvetbelly brews](/doc/the-violet-hour-libations-parlour-via-house-velvetbelly-4uGPTklChT) they found, which Craggy turns down out of principle.

Jethro rejoins the group, picking up a gambler\u2019s rapier and revealing his debt to the pale dwarf [Barduk](/doc/bhardok-the-underlord-Eqst7sfdWd), one of the [Queen\u2019s Men](/doc/the-queens-men-xaYgpxxPXi). The group narrowly avoids a horrifying machine\u2014operated by a pale necromancer and raccoon gunners\u2014before looting delirium from a wrecked building. Investigating a suspiciously tidy house, the crew finds demonic children and an unsettling autopsy scene, leading to a child-slaughtering spell-cast and a hasty escape as [Oscar Yoren](/doc/oscar-yoren-RFyn9kEyvc) returns. Proceeding through Galmarden, they encounter drunken apprentice mages, fend off contamination and tentacled river monsters, and buy questionably cursed goods from a weird market vendor (with Thrulrik donning an inescapable mask). The session ends as they contemplate resting at an ominous clock tower, hoping for respite and plotting next steps.\n\n### Fun Moments\n\nCraggy, covered in purple sludge, desperately asks Jethro for fashion advice: \"Like, all this purple stuff on me, does does does it, like, does it match my eyes? Does this color look kinda good on me?\"\u2014and Jethro responds, \"You should bottle some up and bring it with you.\", The party's reaction upon encountering a tank crewed by raccoons: Jethro panics\u2014\"Guys, we it's bad. There's, a raccoon tank coming down the alley. We need to get out of the way.\" Thrulrik adds, \"A raccoon tank sounds terrible,\" and Craggy chimes in, \"Sounds awesome. No. Terrible. Yeah. Terrible.\", When the party enters the attic full of devil-children, Thrulrik breaks the tension by asking, \"Who is your daddy, and what does he do?\" to which the kids reply, \"Daddy's a doctor... The fun kind,\" sending shivers down everyone's spine., Jethro gives into temptation and eats the mysterious soup, only to discover a gory surprise: \"You take in that broth, it goes down your throat... and then you put the bowl down and you see there's a human finger at the bottom.\" The kids shriek in excitement and Craggy eggs him on: \"Jethro, you you should finish that finger, man. That's considered a delicacy in some places.\", Craggy, living up to his chaotic reputation, uses Thunderwave on the devil-children and then immediately blames Jethro: \"Jethro, I can't believe you did that.\"\n\n[full_transcript(1).txt 162023](/api/attachments.redirect?id=ea269f26-28e5-43d8-a245-e99e9c1f00d4)\n\n### Key Points\n\n\n 1. Jethro receives the Gambler's Blade, a rapier that allows him to choose a bonus (+0 to +3) to attack rolls at each long rest, but he must subtract the same number from death saves until the next long rest.\n 2. Jethro owes debts to the Queen's Men, specifically to Barduk, a pale dwarf seen in the tavern, and was running a gambling grift before fleeing.\n 3. Barduk (pale dwarf) is associated with the Queen's Men and has been seen meeting with Blackjack (normal dwarf); the connection between the Queen's Men and the pale dwarves is unclear.\n 4. Craggy collects a bottle of contaminated pool water to bring back to River.\n 5. The party received multiple lilies from the dwarven princess to deliver.\n 6. The party plans to leave the city via the Temple Gate and return to Emberwood Village, possibly investigating the Queen's Men and the pale dwarves later.\n 7. They discover a pale dwarf corpse with a canine-mauled throat (albino, pink eyes, no pigment), showing little decomposition.\n 8. Rumors from River and the Academy mention \"the pale man\" (Van Lichten), an ex-Amethyst Academy member outcast for lycanthropy experiments and keeping apprentices in cages; he is believed to be conducting further experiments in the city and may have gone mad from delirium poisoning.\n 9. The party suspects Van Lichten is responsible for the canine-style killings and is building an army in the city.\n10. Quavence notes the lack of decomposition in the pale dwarf's corpse and the unusual frequency of albino dwarves, suggesting possible inbreeding or other cause.\n11. The party observes a tank-like machine crewed by raccoons and commanded by a pale man with worms under his skin (presumed Van Lichten).\n12. The tank is armed with crossbows and powered by delirium crystals, which the pale man uses to blast open a building, revealing a large delirium deposit; raccoons collect delirium and are rewarded with maggots.\n13. Thrulrik recovers an 8-ounce delirium shard from the blasted building after the tank leaves.\n14. The party encounters demonic children with cinder-black skin, red eyes, and horns, who reference their 'daddy' (a doctor) and mention his 'dark passenger.'\n15. The children describe the dark passenger as [Azrael, the Pathfinder](/doc/azrael-ENK1L9l9rm), a god who ferries souls from the living to the dead; Oscar Yoren is confirmed to be in contact with Ezrael.\n16. The children mention Oscar Yoren calls Ezrael 'master' and that only doctors (like Oscar and Quavence) can speak with him.\n17. Jethro eats soup from the kitchen and discovers a human finger in the bowl; the soup is confirmed to be made from human meat.\n18. The party finds a book on Ezrael the Pathfinder, bookmarked in a section about demonic entities.\n19. Jethro uses the Wand of Magic Detection to identify an abjuration-protected door upstairs, and the dollhouse contains clay figures matching the party's positions and a blacked-out room with red eyes, corresponding to the abjuration-protected room in the house.\n\n\\\n[full_transcript(1).txt 162023](/api/attachments.redirect?id=ea269f26-28e5-43d8-a245-e99e9c1f00d4)\n\n\\\n",

Ama steals the figurine of Amelia off the wedding cake, and confronts Greyson about what Nightshade whispered to him.\n\nOn the top of the crenelated wall the storm beats down and lightning flashes in the sky, revealing a glint of metal off a circling construct-dragon high above.\n\nAma casts [Pass Without Trace](/doc/pass-without-trace-fPhkwPWEUj) on the crew as they plan to summit the lower tower of the castle, leaving them exposed. Bahruhn uses his monk abilities to run up, and Greyson merely transforms in a mist. They lower ropes as Ramoth uses [Mold Earth](/doc/mold-earth-eBOJbTWVJ4) to create footholds for the others to ascend.\n\nThey are not sneaky enough to get past the dragon, which circles the tower as the party attempts to run across the stone bridge connecting it to the heart tower. As they run for it, the door to the heart tower opens and silhouetted against the heart\u2019s red light is a familiar figure in dark armor, smoke wisping off his flesh as he reveals his face - *[LAMONT SOLMAR](/doc/lamont-solmar-GLrWBoIX5h)!*\n\n> \u201c*You should have killed me properly. I was ready. But she... she still had use for me\u2026.\u201d*\n\nThe dragon circles back and blasts fire on the party, Rado taking severe damage and going down. The dragon uses his great siege abilities to strike at the bridge, sending it cascading into the darkness below. Now the party is separated by a great chasm, with half on one tower and half standing in the doorway of the other.\n\nGreyson fires arrows at Lamont, and Ramoth prepares her eldritch blast.\n\n> *\"You think I serve her for power?\"*\\n*\"No - I serve her because I had nothing left.\"*\\n*\"My children\u2014my blood\u2014they died that day. An accident. A girl too young to control the power she carried inside her. The town called her witch. They dragged her through the mud, noose ready\u2026..\u201d*\\n*\"I stopped them. I gave up everything\u2014my title, my future, my estate  to save her - [Amelia](/doc/amelia-mAibH1T0Em). It was my last human act\u2026\u201d*\n\nLamont drops his sword to the ground, raises his arms in surrender, he takes a step backwards toward the edge of the tower.\n\n> *\u201cThis is all I have left\u2026 I give it freely.\u201d*\n>\n> \\\n\nRamoth unleashes her eldritch blast and instead of resisting Lamont seems to lean into it\u2019s force.\n\nHe goes over the edge and falls into the darkness of the tower, landing with a great thud on the stone hundreds of feet below.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=8ce157cd-817b-441d-bb46-463fe42fef89 \"right-50 =228x326\")They hear a familiar cackle - atop the spire of the tower is Lady Nightshade, surrounded by a prismatic, glowing ball of energy.\n\nThe rest of the party makes it across the chasm to the heart\u2019s tower. The heart beats faster.\n\nDown below, Lamont\u2019s blood seeps into the runes etched in the floor.\n\nThe tower begins to shake. The beating heart gets faster, louder. Thunder claps outside.\n\nThe castle moans, a mechanical shriek rings out as the foundation of this this place cracks.\n\nLooking out through the windows, the stars begin to shift. [Duskmire](/doc/duskmire-hJey19lfsu) tilts and then begins to fall away - no, not fall - the tower is rising.\n\n\\\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=7bbda477-6eea-4b4d-9565-8095365ed126)\n\nBahruhn gets the upper hand on the heart this time, blocking it\u2019s [chain lightning](/doc/chain-lightning-nE4DlilDUR) reaction, as the party wails on it. Blood weeps from it as it finally explodes. But the great engine of the tower has already been set in motion, with Lady Nightshade riding it like a horse into space, and as the heart beats it\u2019s last the tower rockets into space, leaving Pyora behind.\n\n## Into the Stars\n\nThe party retreats into their tiny hut. \n\nAs they talk about what to do next, they hear a knock at the door and a small voice: \u201cTicklecorn?\u201d\n\nThey look out and see Meepo, but something is not right. He is half-construct, some sort of terrible meld of flesh and machine. His mechanical eye glows red. They do not let him in.\n\nIn the night, Bahruhn goes out to examine where Lamont fell.\n\nAll he finds is a blood stain and drag marks, leading into the darkened stairs below. Estelar the Heretic appears in dark robes \u201cThe time has come, the prophecies are being fulfilled. Where is your god now, monk?\u201d\n\n# Session 47 - Lunar Kingdom\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=fe2f8b08-a685-417d-bff0-8e1a53666db4)\n\nThe tower sets down on the surface of the moon. The great engines tick to a stop. The blood left from the heart seeps down the walls. The party emerges from their Tiny Hut, and steps out onto a stark white lunar landscape.\n\n> *As you step out of the tower, your boots crunch into the moonstone sand - the landscape is silent, blindingly white, and impossibly still. Above you stretches the whole host of the heavens, stars that seem brighter and closer and far off in the distance, a small blue speck. Pyora. Home.*\\n\\n*Across this barren expanse you see a line of sapphire colored butterflies, flitting along purposefully towards the crystalline towers in the distance, ringed in by a tall white wall.*\\n\\n*The five immense spires rise from the stark plain of moonstone - crystal and metal fused together, reaching into the blackness of space above. They are beautiful, elegant, and also\u2026 wrong somehow. Ominous and threatening, as they seem to suck up all of the light around them, reflecting it back outwards in a nauseating way.*\n\nA construct gnome appears, introducing himself as FUBAR. The party examines the butterflies and sees that they are the same they saw long ago in the [Sunless Temple](/doc/sunless-temple-yS5i3gqWiO), laden down with some sort of magical, intoxicating pollen. Weary of dragons, Ramoth summons an illusion to cover them as they make their way across sands toward the great white wall that surrounds the towers.\n\n> *The butterflies drift ahead of you, a solemn and colorful procession through the alien landscape. You approach the wall, which encircles the gleaming towers. It\u2019s vast surface gleams with a pearl like luster. You see no gate, no seam, not even a shadow.*\n\nFinding no door and the stone too slick to climb, they approach and search for illusions or see if they can dig under. As they lay a hand on the smooth surface, it ripples revealing elven script: `Give only what the living can`\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=7d619aa8-cc08-4fe6-b8d6-8efb6734f7ef \"left-50 =342x456\")They smear a drop of blood on the wall and it shimmers, revealing a grand gate, open.\n\nBeyond it is an enormous hedge maze, the dark, thorny foliage adorned with a familiar blue flower - [sapphire nightshade](/doc/sapphire-nightshade-Qvbjiqksvy). The butterflies flit from flower to flower. Overhead the glass towers loom, as if watching. The dragons chase each other around the spires.\n\nAs they enter the hedge maze, they try to see if they can pass through. They poke a lance into the foliage and it disappears, pulled by something within. The walls around them seem to shift with every turn or room they enter.\n\nThey turn a corner and find an injured man, tan skin and blonde hair, handsome if he weren\u2019t in such sorry state - dragging himself across the moon sand with an injured leg. \u201cPlease\u2026 friend, help me. They haven\u2019t found me yet.\u201d\n\nGreyson recognizes this man from long ago - it\u2019s [2 Coin](/doc/2-coin-NSUizjoWgU) the pirate. He seems this as a great opportunity to feed on an old foe, and approaches him to do so. But as he leans in to do the deed, 2 Coin transforms into a werewolf with a wicked grin. He howls and several undead hive mind wolves emerge from the moon dust. \u201c2 Coin\u2019s got one last trick for you\u201d as he stands up on his wolf legs and attacks the party. ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=245e054d-e6a5-409a-8777-114a895a6195 \"right-50 =342x456\")\n\nThe party puts up a good fight, and Ramoth manages to momentarily catch 2 Coin in her living net. But 2 Coin summons the power of the hedge maze and seals himself in a corner with Bahruhn. The others fight off the wolves as they hear 2 Coin escape and begin to attack again. Eventually he loses his concentration, the wall he summoned falls, and the rest of the party floods in to land their killing blows.\n\nAs a flash of humanity returns to 2 Coin\u2019s face, he looks at Greyson and says, \u201cWe\u2019re cool\u2026. 2 Coin\u2019s cool\u2026.\u201d before he dies.\n\nGreyson steps over and searches his pockets. He finds a deed to [Gellan Primewater](/doc/gellan-primewater-P10FbIiWH1)\u2019s house all the way back in [Saltmarsh](/doc/saltmarsh-GkGI6ISio5).\n\nThey continue further into the maze, coming upon a great beast who appears to be constructed out of random fleshy parts, dragging a cart laden with corpses behind him. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not dead yet! Yet! Haha!\u201d he calls out as he sees the party. They take stock of their remaining fingers and give them to the cadaver collector, who eyes them wearily \u201cI\u2019ll be back for you eventually.\u201d\n\nHe leaves, turning a corner into the maze draggging his cart behind him. The party decides to follow his tracks, leading them into the center of the maze. They pull out their [Ley Line Lens](/doc/ley-line-lens-A8oN3yTn4x) and see that the towers appear to be shooting ley line energy between them, focusing it on the center of the maze. They continue onwards wearily.\n\nReaching a great clearing near the center, they see a great tree, burnt by some long ago fire growing atop a rocky outcrop. The butterflies swarm it, as if attracted to it\u2019s dark, sticky exterior that appears to secrete\u2026. blood.\n\nThe cadaver collector wheels his cart to 5 open graves in front of it and begins to heave corpses into the holes. Standing with a shovel nearby is construct [Meepo](/doc/meepo-UMrKyHk53I).\n\nThe party approaches. They pear into the graves and see\u2026 themselves. But it\u2019s only an illusion. Meepo intones, \u201cThe lady has a price. You must give up everything - yourselves, each other, your souls - to become great.\u201d he robotically shovels dirt into the graves.\n\nThey approach the great tree and see a door carved into it\u2019s side. They open it and descend down, down down a long stone staircase until they reach a large chamber.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=e5a01a0e-c90f-44f9-bf93-29c0f7874628)Great machinery fills this room. An altar, or operating table, is in the center with some sort of apparatus hanging over it. They notice the apparatus has a giant crystal attached - much like the [Collector of Souls](/doc/collector-of-souls-XA0hpJ7gfE) they used to power the war machine.\n\nOut of the darkness steps an elven man, dark robes and music voice. \u201cJust as the prophecies said. I knew you would make it, just as you made it to Avalon.\u201d\n\n> *\u201cLong ago my druid coven and I, the [Infernal Circle](/doc/the-infernal-circle-8nyqHyTQO2), schemed to bring a new world to life.\u201d*\n>\n> \\\n> *\u201cBut to create something new, the cycle of magic must be stoked by something that resets the balance. Without light, there cannot be darkness. Without good, you cannot have evil. To create, you must also destroy.\u201d*\n>\n> \\\n> *\u201cSo we summoned the dragons to birth a new world using the element we had studied - fire. And in that fire, we created new life - the [dragonborn](/doc/dragonborn-pyoran-Pd8mdtKo6V).\u201d*\n>\n> \\\n> *But we did not understand that we could not control them. Not as we summoned them, in the birthing flames. And so our world burned, but not in the way we envisioned.*\n>\n> \\\n> *\u201cI was the only survivor. The dragons cursed me so I would be able to see their world come to being. And so I saw my people, the elves, pay the ultimate price to end what i had started.\u201d*\n>\n> \\\n> *\u201cBut I must now start what I finished, the same prophecy that brought you here also summoned me to do my part.\u201d*\n>\n> \\\n> *\u201c[Lady Nightshade](/doc/lady-nightshade-3kjLNj2Zbs) has found a way to control the dragons. Reconstructed to pump the blood of the immortal, and powered by the souls of humanity.\u201d*\n>\n> \\\n> *\"Come. It is time. Are you ready to accept the gift of immortality? You will need it in the fight ahead.\u201d*\n\n\\\n",

The Silver Order having departed, they of course explore the keep. Hydrax finds a locked drawer in the entry\u2019s ledger desk, which he promptly pops open to find a few bottles of fine [Durandian](/doc/durandar-sWDxZHDVIC) origin. Hungry for breakfast, Thrulrik looks through the kitchen and finds the ale casks a little light, but they make do with beer-soup in the grand hall. Just as they are discussing all the fun things they can do as deputies - like maybe collect taxes, or go on a patrol - they hear a knock at the front door.\n\nReluctantly they answer it and find two boys, Tib (halfling) & [Henner](/doc/henner-QWV9W3YInL) (human), who are very angry with each other. The boy Henner accuses of the young halfling of cheating at dice and demands a judgement from the Watch. Tib protests, but when the players engage him in a game of Dragonchess they find little to suspect him as a cheat. Hydrax however floats the dice in some water, and finds that they are weighted. Tib uses [Vicious Mockery](/doc/vicious-mockery-ClXBj5mK63) and runs off, while the honest boy thanks them.\n\nThey party goes back to day drinking and scheming and before long they find another knock at the door. This time though it is a welcome sight - Gilbert the dwarven brew cleric, come to make his delivery on his little pull-cart. He asks the deputies for help unloading and they oblige. Gilbert says he brews the best beer here in [Emberwood](/doc/emberwood-village-1Vn0FtePMR) at the [Molten Hop Brewhouse](/doc/molten-hop-brewhouse-CfxGmUVYNA) and invites them to come by sometime for a pint. They get along so well that Gilbert offers them some \u201cspecial brews\u201d in bottles that Quavence detects a hint of magical aura from.\n\n# Patrol\n\nThey wish Gilbert on his way, they decide to get to watch business and go for a patrol of the town, making a great circle through the boulevards and stopping by the Caravan Court to see what vendors might be there (and to collect taxes). They find one guy selling extremely overpriced trinkets, which does not impress them, especially when he is carrying a counterfeit watch badge which they confiscate into \u201cevidence\u201d.\n\nThey are interrupted by an old woman who comes over screaming, \u201cOh my gods the Watch! Come quickly! Something\u2019s wrong at the brew house!\u201d and she leads the party to Gilbert\u2019s Molten Hops, a 3 story building with blood on the porch.\n\n# The Investigation\n\nThe interior of the brewhouse is covered in blood and smashed ale barrels and bottles.\n\nCraggy questions the old lady, who says she comes by for mid day tea with Gilbert daily.\n\nHydrax looks around the outside of the building, and finds a ground floor window smashed in from the outside. Some kind of hair or fur is caught on the sharp edges.\n\nQuavence looks around the brewhouse, seeing wort still bubbling in the fermentor as if Gilbert was interrupted mid-brew. He finds a Jug of Alchemy and a locked box that seems to contain brewing herbs\u2026. and [delirium](/doc/delirium-JlNwOH9FMQ).\n\nThrulrik climbs the ladders to the upper storage areas and finds a grisly scene: Gilbert\u2019s body ripped in two on his bed, blood and viscera everywhere. All around Gilbert he finds strange tracks\u2026 large ones he can\u2019t identify, and lots of little ones\u2026 like rats?\n\nThe party reconvenes and comes up with some theories for the murder.\n\nAs they look for signs of a blood trail to follow, they round the brew house and find a [Vomit Ooze](/doc/vomit-ooze-oyU1zzkSzs) lying in wait. Their attacks split it into several little oozes, which Craggy roasts with his [Chaos Bolt](/doc/chaos-bolt-0DRLKrxEeR).\n\nExhausted and now covered in gross ooze parts, they follow the blood trail across the road south towards\u2026 the [Old Hendrix Farm](/doc/old-hendrix-farm-DNPKQvAKgi).\n\nAs the sky darkens, they hear a panflute. On a nearby stoop is Henner the little boy, wearing a crown made of paper and playing for a small assemblage of rats. The party asks him what he\u2019s doing and he says, \u201cI dunno, they keep running past south down the road. Never seen so many.\u201d\n\nThey deputize the boy with the fake badge and ask him to keep count of how many rats run past.\n\n#### Developments\n\n* The party adjudicates a minor dispute as the Watch, and meets the dwarven brewer.\n* They patrol the streets, finding a vendor committing minor fraud, when they are interrupted by a concerned citizen who reports a murder.\n* They investigate the grisly scene at the Molten Hops Brewhouse, finding several clues, and fighting off an alcoholic ooze.\n* They deputize the honest boy, and ask him to keep an eye on the town rats.\n\n\\\n",

He places his hand on a symbol of an ouroborous, and magical lights blink on the controls, gears within the walls begin to turn, and a great mechanical arm with a large pyramid shaped crystal lights up, throwing radiant light into the room and onto a human shaped altar in the center of the room.\n\n> \u201cThe time of transformation has come.\"\\n\\n\u201dIn every age, heroes fight to turn the great, endless cycle of fate and magic forward.\u201d He goes to a symbol etched in the wall, a snake eating it\u2019s own tail. Placing his hand on it, it lights up.\\n\\n\u201dYou and [lady Nightshade](/doc/lady-nightshade-3kjLNj2Zbs)\u2019s party of knights have been locked in a battle for the soul of the next age.\u201d\\n\\n\u201dEvery living thing either you or her heroes have destroyed or killed on this path has only fueled the acceleration toward this moment.\u201d\\n\\nThe great [crystal](/doc/magic-crystal-olmEylyxjb) at the arm\u2019s end finally lights up in a dazzling display of colors, projected around the room.\\n\\n\u201dDespite my failures, I have always struggled to turn the cycle to transform the world for good.\u201d He looks to Ramoth. \u201cThe [dragonborn](/doc/dragonborn-pyoran-Pd8mdtKo6V) were born into pain, but look at how you have flourished.\u201d\\n\\nHe looks to Bahruhn, \u201cAnd don\u2019t you wish to be a warrior angel for your god, to carry her light into the future?\u201d\\n\\nHe looks to Ama, \u201cYou have experienced the transformation Nightshade wants. Undeath. You overcame it, but your soul has paid a price.\u201d\\n\\nHe sadly looks to Greyson, \u201cAnd you have embraced that darkness fully.\u201d\n\nEstelar turns on the great machine, the crystal that looks so much like the [Collector of Souls](/doc/collector-of-souls-XA0hpJ7gfE) artifact they found so long ago, lights up.\n\n\u201cI once tried to turn the cycle of fate and failed. Now I have a chance to make it right. I can prepare you for the fight ahead.\u201d\n\nRamoth refuses. Bahruhn accepts. Estelar does not offer the others already transformed.\n\nBahruhn lies down on the altar.\n\nEstelar pulls a lever.\n\nAn arc of electrcity goes from the crystal to Bahruhn.\n\nHe glows radiantly - blindingly - and rises from the altar and spreads his wings.\n\nAn angel.\n\nEstelar turns to them, his flesh turns to dust and he collapses into a pile of bones.\n\nAma takes the crystal from the machine, and Greyson takes a scroll from Estelar\u2019s robe.\n\n# Sargoth\u2019s Offer\n\nThe party exits the tree and reemerges under the harsh moon light. They reenter the hedge maze, headed north towards the main tower. They no longer need the Ley Line Lens to see the crackling, necromantic energy above them which arcs from each tower into a miasma of darkness about the north tower. Silhouettes of dragons fly overhead.\n\nThey come to a large circular garden with a fountain of murky black water. In the center, a small stone platform levitates with an impression of a triangle. They are deciding to mage hand putting the pyramid crystal they just took on this platform. When they do so, the whole hedge maze shifts around them and a path reorients in front of them straight to the tower.\n\nBut they notice Greyson is transfixed, staring into the water, and a great big red eye stares back at him. They call out to him but he doesn\u2019t answer. Then tentacles emerge from the murky water and attack, with acidic slime, the large vampire aboleth emerges from the water.\n\nIt stares into Greyson\u2019s eyes and gives him a Command: *finish your transformation, drink the blood of your friends.*\n\nThe party beats Greyson off attempting to snap him out of it as he almost gets Ramoth. \n\nThe aboleth attempts to draw them in by splashing the water out in a grasping wave.\n\nBut the party beats him back, and again he dissapears into a void. Ama and Greyson hang on to the sides of the fountain, their legs dangling into oblivion, but they pull themselves up and out of it.\n\nAbove them the towers bend as if bowing, shooting all their energy at the tower before them.\n\n# The Last Tower\n\nThey approach the crystalline tower, pulsing with energy. No door is in it\u2019s facade, just the familiar symbol of the ouroborous. One by one, they place their hands on it and are teleported into the tower\u2019s lobby.\n\nInside they find no doors, a circular room with walls of glass, and two balconies twenty feet above. A symbol on the ground, and a panel of symbols above it, are splashed with bright red blood. On the floor is a member of the Crimson Court in their robe and mask, apparently stabbed.\n\nThey go to the figure and remove the mask, finding [Lady Nysarra](/doc/lady-nyssara-J5Xln2dPek), \u201cYou must\u2026 stop her\u2026 she is going to destroy the world\u2026\u201d she passes out.\n\nThey begin trying to figure out the symbols on the wall. Greyson touches an hourglass only he and Bahruhn can see and stands in a cosmic hallway, meteors shooting past. He leaps around them and Lady Nightshade appears out of a magic portal, banishing him through a dimension door back to the lobby of the tower \u201c*You haven\u2019t paid the price, you are not ready.\u201d*\n\nThey experiment and figure this must be a wizard elevator, and start to be more strategic. They press a pyramid symbol and are transported to an observation room containing a giant telescope pointed at the little blue globe of Pyora far away.\n\nThey attempt to figure out the telescope and finally see through it: The path of their rocket tower has left a trail of nightshade colored dust through space, and Pyora\u2019s atmosphere appears to be covered in a giant storm cloud of it.\n\n> *They think back to their note from [Caelum the Druid](/doc/caelum-the-druid-SHH5bzkRpF), on how nightshade could react with moonlight to transform\u2026.*\n\nRamoth sends out her familar through the door to the outside balcony to take a look around and is immediately eldritch blasted. An elven wizard and several Crimson Court attired figures float into the room through the open doorway.\n\nThey recognize him: [Elarion Gearsong](/doc/elarion-gearsong-5hUorix4Zk). From [Avalon](/doc/avalon-7amKaC2AMg).\n\n\u201cAh, isn\u2019t it beautiful? I have resurrected in the dragons. My research has finally completed, thanks to you.\u201d\n\nThe Crimson Court mages remove their masks - they are draconic constructs - simulacrum of the dragonborn.\n\n\u201cWhen the process is complete, the moonlight will transform all of Pyora into lycanthropes, and they will worship the Lady Nightshade on the moon forever. She\u2019ll be as a god! Bwahahahahhaha!\u201d\n\nThe mages attack, flinging spells and mechanical dragonbreath, but the party beats back the cultists at great cost.",

However, you can also use the statistics to represent nonhuman lycanthropes, adding verisimilitude by allowing a nonhuman lycanthrope to retain one or more of its humanoid racial traits. For example, an elf werewolf might have the Fey Ancestry trait.\n\n## Wereboar\n\nWereboars are ill-tempered and vulgar brutes. As humanoids, they are stocky and muscular, with short, stiff hair. In their humanoid and hybrid forms, they use heavy weapons, while in hybrid or animal form, they gain a devastating goring attack through which their curse is spread. A wereboar infects other creatures indiscriminately, relishing the fact that the more its victims resist the curse, the more savage and bestial they become.\n\nWereboars live in small family groups in remote forest areas, building ramshackle huts or dwelling in caves. They are suspicious of strangers but sometimes ally themselves with orcs.\n\n\\\n",

After some heated city-intrusion strategizing (including a failed attempt to phone a friend, musings on [wereboar](/doc/wereboar-dbjcRjiQst)-wrangling options, and Jethro\u2019s alcohol-hazy tunnel memories), the crew dropped incriminating beer off with caustic barkeep Gorthar, warned him to lay low, and interrogated a drugged-up horse thief for four emaciated horses (resorting to wedgies and slapstick). Riding into war-torn Galmarden, the gang rallied demoralized Silver Order knights and led a desperate assault on the Temple Gates, facing waves of Garamir dogmen and a grotesque siege giant. Highlights: Jorg\u2019s endless melee whiff-fest, Jethro\u2019s dice-luck and evil eye, Quavence\u2019s mega-fog and healing, Craggy\u2019s wild magic resilience, and Harrowhark\u2019s hellhound polymorph nuking the boss. Victory secured, the battered crew stabilized, divvied up healing potions, won (or vomited) at dice, took a much-needed rest, and learned a rival is speeding for the lilies\u2014as a full moon rises.\n\n### Key Points\n\n\n 1. Jorg and Jethro join/rejoin the party at the watchtower; Jethro is a smaller dwarf with a large beard and a scar over his eye.,\n 2. The party's mission is to retrieve Eldritch Lilies from the Queen's Garden in northwest Gael Mardin for River.,\n 3. The Queen's Garden is located in northwest Gael Mardin, near the Slaughter Stones, as confirmed by a map at Oscar Yoren Manor.,\n 4. Known entry options into Gael Mardin include the tunnel (emerges at Slaughter Stone Square, guarded by a giant machine), the major gates, and possibly other tunnels (Jethro vaguely recalls underground gambling dens).\n 5. Jorg's experience confirms the Temple Gates (southwest, near Chapel of Saint Brenna) are a major conflict zone between the Silver Order and Garamir (dogmen), with many corpses found there.\n 6. The party discusses using interdimensional shackles from River to restrain Theodore Marshall if needed, but decides to let River handle him for now.,\n 7. Theodore Marshall is gravely ill and the Lord Commander is temporarily taking over; the knights are keeping this quiet to avoid panic.,\n 8. The party delivers a barrel of unfinished, delirium-tainted ale from One Eyed Mountain Brewery to Gorthar for safekeeping and analysis, warning him to lay low due to recent threats and raids.,\n 9. Gorthar confirms the old windmill (where the ale was headed) hasn't been operational since before the city fell; the Eichmanns who owned it have fled.,\n10. Blackjack Mel is suspected of collaborating with the gnomes and possibly responsible for graffiti threats against Gorthar; Mel owes Gorthar a significant gambling debt.,\n11. Hinner alerts the party to a suspicious man with four emaciated horses near the bridge; the man is identified as a drug-addled horse thief using Black Diamond.,\n12. After a failed negotiation and scuffle, the party takes possession of the four horses; the thief flees after being given some beer.,\n13. At the Temple Gates, the party finds a blood-soaked battlefield, barricades, and about a dozen demoralized Silver Order knights; Garamir (dogmen) patrol the battlements above.,\n14. Craggy delivers a rousing speech and, with Jorg's use of the Guildmaster's Hunting Horn (targeting dogmen), successfully rallies the knights to join in an assault on the gates.,\n15. A grotesque giant emerges as the Garamir leader, using a great club and hurling rocks; it has multiattack and high Constitution saves.,\n16. Jethro blinds and deafens the grotesque giant for a minute using Curse of the Incessant (all Jinx points spent).\n17. The grotesque giant is ultimately slain by a combination of attacks, including a hellhound-form Harrowhark's fire breath and Jethro's sneak attack critical hit, causing the remaining Garamir to flee. \n18. The Silver Order knights reward the party with five basic healing potions (one per party member).,\n19. Craggy drinks a truth serum (Dark Truth) and communes with Proteus, the dwarven god of drinking, asking: \"Is someone on track to beat us to the Eldritch Lilies?\" The answer is YES.,\n20. Quavence notes that it is a full moon, increasing the urgency to retrieve the lilies for River.\n\n### Fun Moments\n\n* Craggy, unimpressed by Jethro's stature, quips, \"Did you find this, runt? ... Did you find him shoveling shit?\" leading to the revelation that Jethro is \"pretty good at darts\" and definitely not dead yet.,\n* Steve (as Jorg) heroically declares, after copious failed sword swings against a single dogman: \"It's just ain't Jorg's night. It's like those old cartoons of Goofy trying to hit the ball in the sand trap, just keeps missing.\",\n* Jethro gets in a slap fight with a jittery horse thief: \"I'm just gonna slap them back. I slap him back.\" It ends with a spectacular display of mutual flailing and zero actual hits.,\n* GM, after the group\u2019s rousing speech to the depressed soldiers: \"'No, no, men. We've signed up to sacrifice our lives if needed, but we will sit around and deplete our resources, our morale, our life no more. If you're with me, follow that guy,' and I point at Jorg.\" Even the GM can't help but acknowledge the accidental comedy of it all.,\n* Craggy, after chugging a mystery beverage in the barracks, realizes too late: \"You down it, and then you look at the label and it says ... liquid dog food. You just vomit everywhere.\" Followed up by a halfling cussword and collapse into bed.\n\n[full_transcript.txt 155471](/api/attachments.redirect?id=ab31d1c6-888a-4647-a61c-6f2248939849)\n\n\\\n",

As they walk down the boardwalk to the gleaming white ship, they see [Keledek](/doc/keledek-the-wizard-jGCH5H0n7q) the Wizard arguing angrily with [Lieutenant Dan](/doc/lieutenant-daniel-warrington-OHzOMkhMHS) and some burly looking [Iron Riders](/doc/iron-riders-of-abraxas-P77pTaxjou). \n\n> The wizard Keledek stood on the rickety wooden planks of the dock, towering over the Iron Riders who had surrounded him. He wore a flowing robe of midnight purple, embroidered with silver runes that glimmered in the afternoon sunlight. The guards tensely brandished spears, their expressions hardened by suspicion.\n>\n> \\\n> \"What is the meaning of this?\" the wizard demanded, his voice echoing across the still waters of the harbor. \"This shipment contains nothing but harmless talismans and arcane artifacts. Why have you deemed it illegal magic?\"\n>\n> \\\n> The leader of the Riders stepped forward, his eyes narrowed. \"I\u2019m Lieutenant Warrington, and I\u2019m in charge of enforcement at the docks now. We've had reports of dark magic being smuggled into the city,\" he said, his voice gruff. \"We won\u2019t take any chances. We have orders to inspect every shipment that comes through the docks.\"\n\nKrack manages to subtlety cast [Command](/doc/command-jyhvV2rIzc), and tells the Lieutenant to leave the wizard alone. In their stare down, the Lieutenant blinks and tells his men to back off. He tells Keledek that he\u2019s watching him very closely. Keledek thanks Krack, saying he dared not try a trick like that with the men watching him. He tells the party to come visit him at his tower some time.\n\nThe party continues down the board walk and comes to *The Dragon\u2019s Jubilee*, which appears to be magically enchanted.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=446849ee-b165-438d-9273-deaccaa0d29a)\n\n> As the boat sits at the dock, it seems to radiate a sense of calm and serenity, as if it were a living creature at rest. You watch as its sails furl themselves up neatly one by one, the magic within them causing he ropes and pulleys to move in perfect synchronization. The boat's anchor lowered itself down into the water, the sound of the chain clanking against the hull echoing across the harbor. A galleyway descends to the dock by unseen magic. Welcome aboard.\n\nTwo armed [Dragonborn wearing silver robes and the insignia of the sun](/doc/the-silver-suns-Qtggev16EG) around their necks stop the party, and ask their names which they check against the guest list. They ask the party to openly display their weapons and arcane focuses before boarding. Krack hides a small dagger from them.\n\n## The Party Starts\n\nAboard the ship they find [Anders](/doc/anders-solmor-njTKn6ITMV), his assistant [Skerrin](/doc/skerrin-wavechaser-sCnR3QOnff), [Gellan Primewater](/doc/gellan-primewater-P10FbIiWH1), [Father Ettria](/doc/ettria-fuNZjqM9yB), the long lost [Captain Strezza](/doc/strezza-pvL6kQtaEA), and a uniformed Striborg Navy officer who introduces himself as [Commodore Wardell Warrington](/doc/commodore-wardell-warrington-JVLIYKxGXE). The ship\u2019s first mate, the wizard [Wexley](/doc/wexley-6ah4bkHmdf), takes Hilmita down into the bilge to show her some fun rats that live down there. [Captain Fireborn](/doc/eliander-fireborn-GSljW693Ga) greets Father Ettria, making a joke about how it\u2019s good luck to have a dwarf priest on board. Captain Strezza then challenges everyone to a dagger throwing contest. The Commodore wagers a large sum of money, which he loses to Strezza and the players. Gellan shows everyone to their rooms, and invites them to look around the ship. Krack stashes the hidden dagger in the chest provided.\n\nThey go out to the dining room where Gellan is entertaining all the guests. They are shocked to see Gellan sitting next (and holding hands with) none other than [2 Coin](/doc/2-coin-NSUizjoWgU). Captain Fireborn and and Commodore Warrington are discussing business with Anders Solmor while Skerrin listens in. The Commodore is telling Anders that Striborg is interested in investing much more in Saltmarsh, and that they will need a lot of shipbuilding capacity. The Commodore tells him that his son, Lieutenant Daniel Warrington, will call on him and Skerrin at their office to discuss the details. They shake hands, smiling.\n\nGellan bids the party to sit down and says, \u201cWhy not play some cards until dinner is served? Tonight\u2019s chef is a very special (and very expensive) culinary artist from the New City, and it will be out shortly\u2026\u201d he dings a wine glass with his fork \u201cI propose a toast to all the dear friends tonight, and to our continued friendship in our beloved town of Saltmarsh.\u201d Everyone cheers.\n\nThe party and guests plays a round of [Kobold\u2019s Knuckles](/doc/games-within-games-sADBBiMsrR) to pass the time, and eventually a large, hulking man with green-tinged skin and large front canine teeth comes out dressed in chef\u2019s whites, his neat top-knot almost brushing the wooden ceiling of the banquet hall.\n\n\u201cMy guests it is my pleasure to serve you tonight, I am the ship\u2019s chef, [Urguad](/doc/urgaud-gnasher-h87tyDOnpi). This is the first course, and the remainder is coming from the kitchen\u2026\u201d He speaks with a strange accent you can\u2019t place.\n\n ![Urgaud Gnasher](/api/attachments.redirect?id=a9863a1d-fb49-4894-9cad-18b0e9a5d56b)\n\nHe sets down plates of boar sausage with berries, goat stew with fruit and nuts, broiled cave fisher, and a spiced meatloaf. \u201cJust one moment, I will get the rest\u2026\u201d\n\nCommodore Warrington and Captain Fireborn are a little drunk, and red faced the Commodore says, \u201cLet us help you Chef, I have been looking forward to this meal since I received Gellan\u2019s invite - let us old soldiers be of use.\u201d Both Warrington and Fireborn stand up and go through a small door to the galley, bringing back more aromatic trays of delicious food.\n\n## The First Murders\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=49599ca0-bd8f-4dcc-9263-5f79e6d5ab97)\n\nAs everyone enjoys the meal, suddenly, a mist begins to form in the room. At first, everyone looks around to see if one of the oil lanterns is smoking, but it continues to thicken until no one can see anything in the room. It is full of [magical fog](/doc/fog-cloud-bpCrF9XmLE).\n\nFrom within the chaos the party hears glasses being overturned, a scream, the sounds of a struggle, and then\u2026 an ominous gurgling. As the fog clears, in the middle of the table is the body of Skerrin and a large pool of blood. His throat has been slashed with a bone dagger to the point he\u2019s almost been decapitated. Gellan and 2 Coin are standing at the head of the table aghast. Commodore Warrington has drawn his cutlass and points it accusingly, as Fireborn puts a hand on his shoulder as if to hold him back.\n\nFather Ettria reaches for the arcane focus gem he keeps around his neck and cries out, \u201cMy gem!! It\u2019s gone! I must [revivify](/doc/revivify-OlWQ5hb4iZ) him before it\u2019s too late!\u201d He reaches across the table and snatches a jeweled necklace from Anders neck. As everyone watches in horror, the priest bows his head and says a prayer to his god in the old dwarven tongue. He touches the gem to Skerrin\u2019s wound and it stitches itself up, healing. Skerrin takes a deep breath, and immediately vomits blood and is overcome with wrenching. \n\nEveryone looks terrified. The Commodore looks accusingly at Krack, the spellcaster, \u201cYou did this! You are the only wretched trickster on this ship!\u201d As they argue, suddenly, Father Ettria projectile vomits across the room a green and foul smelling substance. He collapses into seizures. Everyone rushes to help him, but he\u2019s dead. A green foam leaks from his mouth.\n\nThe party looks around for another gem of sufficient value to pull off revivify again, but the Commodore only has a lesser gem on his ceremonial dagger. They look underneath the table, and find a vial stuck to the bottom - it smells of [dreadful poison](/doc/nightshade-poison-rGISMbm8AA).\n\nThe priest is dead and the boat is far away from the shore. The weather outside turns to rain and thunder. Everyone on board looks around the room with paranoia and fear. Gellan suggest they all lock themselves in their rooms for the night and get some sleep.\n\n## The Third Murder\n\nIn the night, the party sets up a partial watch in the hall. On Greyson\u2019s turn, he hears footsteps and eventually sees the light of a candle. 2 Coin has come up from the lower rooms to fetch a decanter of wine (or two). He chit chats with Greyson, who is unaware of his past encounters with the party. No one else walks the halls at night.\n\nIn the dawn light, they hear a scream. Commodore Warrington is yelling, and standing at the door of Captain Fireborn\u2019s room. The Captain has a bone dagger sticking out of his eye, dead in his bed. The port hole window in the room is slightly ajar, having let in some of the rain to ruin the Captain\u2019s pile of books on his night stand.\n\n# Session 16\n\n## Hilmita and the Wizard\n\nUnaware of all this, Hilmita the Druid is getting a tour of the non-guest portions of the boat. Down in the boat\u2019s bilge, where the crew\u2019s quarters sit on a platform above the ship\u2019s watery ballast, the Wizard Wexley is showing her that for some reason there\u2019s a bunch of little leaks in the hull. They are both going around casting [Mending](/doc/mending-IveWgtiPdn) to fix them. \n\n ![Wexley](/api/attachments.redirect?id=67d3696e-9226-47a9-91a6-26f17bcd8587 \" =1024x\")Hilmita wonders if the cause is something lurking in the boat causing them, so she casts [Faerie Fire](/doc/faerie-fire-U6OEBgDJvu) into the darkness of the ship\u2019s underbelly. It only illuminates a few small rats. She examines the holes again and see that it looks like they were made with some kind of tool, from the outside? The wizard pats her head reassuringly and says there\u2019s no danger, but maybe she should go back up for dinner.\n\n## Accusations and Clues\n\nWhen she emerges upstairs she finds the dawn light trickling in and a bunch of bleary-eyed people standing around arguing over a corpse. The Commodore is busy accusing the New Galmaardian crew, the party, anyone. He is quite upset by the death of his friend. Anders is trying to talk reason to him, saying that justice will be done - the city of Saltmarsh will not tolerate an attack on anyone close to the Council or any of the Council\u2019s guests.\n\nThe party looks around the room for anything strange, and they uncover a small component pouch like what a spellcaster would use. Hilmita opens it, and finds inside a bundle of spiderwebs and a small spider crawls out. Krack recognizes that this is a component of [Spider Climb](/doc/spider-climb-H6nEMZuLZV) - the assassin came in through the window, not the door?\n\nThe Commodore says, \u201cSee! She knows! She did it! We should search her room! She probably has the Father\u2019s missing gem!\u201d They argue over this and agree they will all show the contents of their wardrobe chests. Krack opens hers and they find the hidden dagger\u2026. But it\u2019s not made of bone. \n\nThey go through and no one has anything suspicious. Gellan protests that he doesn\u2019t want to show his because of \u201cprivate business papers\u201d but the Commodore at this point is on a roll. He insists. Gellan opens his chest with his key, and they find\u2026 the Father\u2019s missing gem, next to a letter with the broken wax seal of Gellan.\n\nThe party reads the letter:\n\n> My Dearest 2 Coin,\n>\n> I am convinced that Anders and Skerrin know about us, and are plotting with the Commodore and Captain to reveal our operations. I don\u2019t know how he knows, we were so careful\u2026\n>\n> Don\u2019t worry my love, I have a solution to this problem. I will take care of it tonight.\n>\n> Yours truly,\n>\n> Gellan\n\nThe Commodore is triumphant: \u201cAha! A smuggler and a murderer!\u201d He throws Gellan in a room and locks him in. \u201cWe\u2019ll bring this man to justice when we return to port.\u201d He sneers at Krack and the party.\n\n## The Investigation\n\nThe party decides it might not be great for their patron to be arrested. They begin their own investigation, starting with Gellan\u2019s room. They try to determine if the lock was picked, or if magic was used here in the room, but they don\u2019t see anything suspicious. The lock on the chest is so simple it could have been picked by anyone, really. They look the letter over, and being familiar with Gellan\u2019s handwriting\u2026 they see it\u2019s not quite right. It looks like a forgery to them.\n\nHilmita decides to [Wild Shape](/doc/wild-shape-bCuGgQx5Y9) into a rat so she can spy on people and use her enhanced sense of smell. She immediately notices that in this room, there is the undercurrent smell of rot.. like rotten meat. Attempting to sneak around the guests quarters, she tries to see if it\u2019s associated with anyone\u2019s room, but it\u2019s too hard to pick it out.\n\nThey haven\u2019t talked to Skerrin, and they find him in his quarters, resting and drinking tea. He fingers the scar around his neck, not quite gone. When the party asks him questions, he says he suspects that it\u2019s the Commodore consolidating power and removing potential rivals. As he recounts this, the players notice he seems to get a little excited at the idea.\n\nThe party decides to interview the crew, so they pocket Hilmita and go down to where Wexley and Captain Strezza are in the crew\u2019s quarters. Hilmita does not detect the rotten smell down here. Instead when they knock and open the door to the Captain\u2019s quarters, they are met with a wall of herbal pipe smoke. The Captain and Wexley are lounging around passing a fragrant pipe between them, playing a game of cards.\n\n\u201cCome to get away from the chaos, eh?\u201d Wexley says as he deals in Strezza.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re staying the fuck out of this mess, let the important people upstairs figure it out. As soon as this ship hits harbor, we\u2019re out of here.\u201d\n\nThe party inquires whether they could get a ride out of here if things go further south, and the Captain says, \u201cOf course\u201d. They ask if the wizard has any spells that might help them locate an undead or fiend on board. He looks through his papers, and casts it as a ritual. As he exhales from his pipe it forms into a hand, pointing upwards to the main deck\u2026\n\nThey leave the crew to their game before Hilmita\u2019s Wild Shape runs out. They go up to the deck where the Commodore, Anders, and Skerrin are having a serious talk about what to do with Gellan when they return. \u201cObviously Gellan\u2019s guilty\u2026\u201d they overhear as they approach.\n\nKrack goes to hug all of the people gathered, thanking them for their work finding the apparent killer. As she does so, Hilmita is in her pocket attempting to sniff out the rotten smell. But unfortunately, it\u2019s too windy up on the deck.\n\n## The Murderer Revealed\n\nThe party decides they need to come up with a better plan. They look through their supplies, and find several vials of Holy Water. They decide to brew some tea with it to take out and have Hilmita serve to the guests. They wait until everyone is gathered in the main banquet room, and bring in the steaming cups of tea\u2026\n\nEveryone takes a sip. When Skerrin is the last to drink he coughs, stands up, and pushes his chair back. He rushes to the door as if ill, and the party watches his silhouette in the dusk light of the doorway as it grows taller and sprouts demonic looking antlers, flesh rending into rotten infection teeming with maggots. It turns toward the assembled people with glowing red eyes, and growls.\n\nMost of the guests and Krack are terrified at this, but the party moves in to attack this fell beast that they recognize from the mines. Tharac runs in first but he is smitten with a [Charm Person](/doc/charm-person-UxSYwJXpea) incantation, as the monster seems to move so quickly as to vanish and reappear on the opposite end of the deck.\n\nThe boat is approaching Saltmarsh. In the distance, the party sees bright lights and smoke.\n\nThey press on with attacks but the monster mostly shrugs them off. It casts Mirror Image, and suddenly there are 4 terrifying figures on the deck. It summons wolves to his side, and they run down the deck to attack. Hilmita transforms into a Giant Spider, and attempts to ensnare one of the figures and also keep Tharac from acting on his arcane influence. She scampers up the ship\u2019s flag pole. The monster approaches Greyson and lays his hands on him, bestowing a [Curse](/doc/bestow-curse-JkFieo690v).\n\nThe other players land attacks, including a brutal one from Krack, but they are no match for the monster. He casts [Gust](/doc/gust-of-wind-bU2LbTtimz) and sends both Tharac and Greyson almost overboard, clinging to the deck\u2019s railing. They look down the water below them and see a phalanx of sahuagin monsters swimming beneath the surface, dozens of them prepared for war\u2026\n\nHilmita uses her spider web to move from ship mast to mast, and prepares to leap and attack the monster from above. However, the monster casually walks vertically up the mast and hits her with his own blow.\n\nAs it looks very bad for the party, the boat magically approaches the dock and lets it\u2019s anchor down. The monster slowly feather falls to the deck, steps foot back onto the docks, and turns into a cloud of mist that dissipates into the night beneath the full moon.\n\nAs they approach Saltmarsh, they see that it\u2019s not festival lights that lights the town, but fires. The city is engulfed in flame and the air is full of the sound of screaming\u2026\n\n\\\n[Sahuagin](/doc/sahuagin-MkRLEKcGhh) emerge from the water, committing indiscriminate murder in their lust for blood.\n\nThe dwarves are rioting - brawling with the [Town Guard](/doc/saltmarsh-town-guard-v63eLpRU1Q) and burning down [The Dwarven Anvil](/doc/the-dwarven-anvil-1tj8fn0d9l).\n\nAn unholy purple light emanates from up the hill where the graveyard sits, [Eda Oweland](/doc/eda-oweland-HEslJp2L08) rides in a palanquin carried by an army of undead knights down the hill.\n\n[The Iron Riders](/doc/iron-riders-of-abraxas-P77pTaxjou) are armed to the teeth, weapons out, shields blazing with arcane protections as they escort an armored caravan out of city away from the chaos.\n\n\\\nOn this high night of the Feast, Saltmarsh burns.\n\n\\\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=93508278-4bee-49ab-8584-1989f97ad126)\n\n\\\n",

Opting to leave their emaciated horses behind, the group made swift (but not stealthy) progress, running into a chasm of brackish, haze-producing magma, where they encountered rats and were ambushed by two horrifying cloaker creatures. The fight saw Jorg face-sucked and airborne, panic saves, spells and tentacles flying, and eventually, the monsters were slain\u2014with assistance from rat folk snipers. In the overgrown Queen\u2019s Garden, the party navigated mystical paths, bowed to statues, received mysterious tarot cards, avoided eating suspect flowers (sorry, Craggy), and then tried to loot from headless dwarf statues\u2014triggering a brawl with local trolls and a Yeti. Victory, healing, and a loot grab ensued (spell scroll, magic dagger, and assorted oddball potions), while Craggy finished with an act of symbolic royalist-abuse via shatter spell on the statues. The party remains hot on the trail of the elusive eldritch lilies, wary of the rival (pale) dwarves possibly being ahead.\n\n### Key Points\n\n\n1.

The Queen's Court (where the lilies are) is north of the Temple Gate; Oscar Yoren's map was seen at Reed Manor but not taken.\n3. Rain may be coming, but it does not reduce the haze's effects.\n4. Craggy has gained a divination ability (clairvoyance-like, \\~1 mile range) after interacting with Proteus.\n5. If you die in the haze, your body will not rot and may return as a husk.\n6. Our horses are emaciated and terrified of the haze; we leave them with the knights for care and proceed on foot.\n7. A Silver Order page mentions seeing a tank with a pale rider in the city, possibly powered by delirium.\n\n\n 8. We encounter a major intersection blocked by a 20-25 foot wide chasm of burning, haze-producing lava, which increases the haze in the area.\n 9. A ratfolk is spotted hiding near the chasm and later helps by throwing a delirium bomb at an attacking aberration.\n10. A shriek from a flying aberration (cloaker-like) forces a DC 13 Wisdom save; failure causes the frightened condition.\n11. The aberration can attach to a target's face, blinding and suffocating them, and carries them into the air.\n12. Ratfolk allies on the far side of the chasm assist with crossbows during the fight.\n13. The aberrations can create illusory duplicates (Phantasm), making them harder to target.\n14. After defeating the aberrations, the ratfolk advise us to \"stick to the alleys\" for a safer route north.\n15. Graffiti in thieves' cant found in the alley references 'Underdog Town' and is punctuated with a diamond symbol, indicating Queen's Men involvement.\n16. The party uses a potion of clairvoyance to scout the Queen's Garden, confirming it is less than a mile north, shrouded in heavy haze, and surrounded by notable landmarks.\n17. Entry to the Queen's Garden is guarded by undead ceremonial knights at a gazebo; they demand tickets, but accept five gold for entry.\n18. In a magical grove, the party finds a statue of a dwarven woman in repose, surrounded by will-o-wisps (witch lights) that communicate cryptically and leave a tarot card (Six of Pentacles) on Quavence's forehead.\n19. The will-o-wisps whisper in Dwarvish: \"La Lorana, daughter of Ulfgard Wivesbeard,\" referencing the first daughter of King Ulfgard Wivesbeard.\n20. Trolls (one transformed into a yeti after eating a nightshade flower) confront the party, claiming the altar and offerings as theirs; they mention that 'white dwarves' (pale dwarves) have been bringing them gifts and are also searching for the lilies.\n\n[full_transcript.txt 171626](/api/attachments.redirect?id=842f2f57-7af4-4f58-ac79-8c3dd7d9d170)\n\n\\\n",

Hit: 11 (`2d6 + 4`) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 14) if the devil isn't already grappling a creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and takes 7 (`2d6`) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns.\n\n***Animate Chains (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** Up to four chains the devil can see within 60 feet of it magically sprout razor-edged barbs and animate under the devil's control, provided that the chains aren't being worn or carried.Each animated chain is an object with AC 20, 20 hit points, resistance to piercing damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage. When the devil uses Multiattack on its turn, it can use each animated chain to make one additional chain attack. An animated chain can grapple one creature of its own but can't make attacks while grappling. An animated chain reverts to its inanimate state if reduced to 0 hit points or if the devil is incapacitated or dies.\n\n### Reactions\n\n***Unnerving Mask.*** When a creature the devil can see starts its turn within 30 feet of the devil, the devil can create the illusion that it looks like one of the creature's departed loved ones or bitter enemies. If the creature can see the devil, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its turn.\n\n## Chain Devil\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=b5709e5e-32a9-4388-be7d-42b4413e31a3)\n\nThis ominous fiend wears chains like a shroud. Driving lesser creatures before it with its fearsome gaze, a chain devil animates the chains that cover its body as well as inanimate chains nearby, which sprout hooks, blades, and spikes to eviscerate enemies.\n\nChain devils act as sadistic jailers and torturers in the infernal realms, relishing pain and living to inflict it on others. They are called on to torment mortal souls trapped in the Nine Hells, inflicting their sadistic fury on the horrid lemures in which those souls manifest.\n\n\n---\n\n- [x] Source - [Monster Manual p72](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#chain%20devil_mm)\n\n\\\n",

If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target's head, and the target is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check.\n\n***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:*  +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) slashing damage.\n\n***Moan.*** Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan and that isn't an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of the cloaker's next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker's moan for the next 24 hours.\n\n***Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.\\nWhenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can't see or if it relies on senses other than sight.\\nA duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.\n\n## Cloaker\n\nCloakers earned their names for the resemblance they bear to dark leathery cloaks. Lurking in remote dungeons and caves, these stealthy predators wait to slay lone or injured prey stumbling through the darkness.\n\n***Camouflaged Lurkers.*** Like a stingray, a cloaker's body is composed of cartilage and muscle. With its tail and fins unfurled, it flies through darkness and lurks among the shadows of caverns the same way a stingray glides through water and hides on the ocean floor. Parallel rows of round, black eyespots run along its back like buttons, and the ivory-colored claws on its cowl resemble bone clasps.\n\nWhen a cloaker unfurls and moves to attack, it reveals its pale underside and makes its true nature evident. Red eyes glow above rows of sharp teeth, and a long pendulous tail whips behind it.\n\n***Opportunistic Predators.*** When hunting, cloakers glide through the shadows at a safe distance behind groups of other creatures traversing the Underdark. They follow parties of humanoids to prey on the wounded after a battle, or pursue herds of Underdark beasts, attacking the sick, the weak, or the straggling.\n\nCloakers strike quickly and consume their meals as swiftly as possible, enveloping and devouring their victims. While it feeds, a cloaker uses its swift, whiplike tail for defense, although it rarely takes a stand against dangerous foes or groups of creatures. As an added defense, cloakers can create illusory duplicates of themselves.\n\n***Haunting Moan.*** Cloakers' thoughts are alien to other life-forms, and they communicate with one another through subsonic moans inaudible to most creatures. At higher intensities, a cloaker's haunting moan becomes audible, evoking sensations of doom and dread in creatures that hear it.\n\n***Cloaker Conclaves.*** Cloakers prefer isolation, but they sometimes convene with other cloakers for defense or to exchange information about new dangers, suitable hunting grounds, or developments that might affect their habitats. When this convergence is complete, the cloakers separate again.",

Creatures who fail their saving throw by 5 or more gain one *level of contamination*.\n>\n> ##### Variant: Leeching\n>\n> ***Bounding Leap.*** The leeching dreg's long jump is up to 30 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.\n>\n> ***Blood Drain.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage, and the dreg attaches to the target. While attached, the dreg can't attack. Instead, at the start of each of the dreg's turns, the target takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.\n>\n> The attached dreg moves with the target whenever the target moves, requiring none of the dreg's movement. The dreg can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement on its turn. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the dreg.\n>\n> ##### Variant: Lurking\n>\n> ***Normal Semblance.*** The lurking dreg has advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks to pass itself off as a normal humanoid creature.\n>\n> ***Sneak Attack (1/Turn).*** The dreg deals an extra 7 (2d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the dreg that isn't incapacitated and the dreg doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.\n>\n> ##### Variant: Spined\n>\n> ***Spider Climb.*** The spined dreg has a climb speed equal to its walking speed. It can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.\n>\n> ***Multiattack.*** The dreg makes three spike attacks.\n>\n> ***Spike.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage.\n>\n> ##### Variant: Tentacled\n>\n> ***Amorphous.*** The tentacled dreg can move through a space as narrow as 6 inches wide without squeezing.\n>\n> ***Tentacles.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the tentacled dreg can't use its tentacles on another target.\n\n## Delerium Dreg\n\n*Who knows how many of these twisted abominations were once our steadfast comrades, friends, and loved ones. When you see these lost souls, you must not hesitate.*\u2014 Elias DrexelMany who succumb to *contamination* become grotesque mockeries of their former selves. They suffer a wretched and loathsome fate, aimlessly wandering the ruins following half-forgotten memories. Most are gripped by despair, fear, and madness which drive them to act violently, though a rare few experience lucidity and a gruesome awareness of their miserable state. Their distorted and emaciated bodies are sustained by the magic of the Haze.",

These wretched monsters suffer from a constant internal struggle between cowardly survival instincts and violent impulsive urges. Ratlings dream of eating everything, and will eat anything, but love eating people. They especially love eating babies. While they will subsist on carrion, ratlings take captives back to their lairs so they can have fresh food later. Thousands of ratlings dwell in the city. They form warring colonies that dig maze-like burrows featuring multiple entrances and tight looping passages. Successful colonies grow in number quickly, as ratlings mature in a matter of weeks when ample food and delerium are available.",

In a topiary garden of high, manicured walls full of thorns and poisonous looking flowers, several plant-people wearing royal looking dresses go about clipping the hedges and performing gardening tasks.

The party agrees, and the princess turns into a tree.\n\n\n---\n\n# Auto Bot Summary\n\n**Recap** The party struggled through the magical, looping Queen's Garden, dealing with troll remains, haunted statues, and a new party inventory system. Craggy had a brief psychic t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with a statue, while the group got strongarmed (and eared) by undead garden guards into repeatedly paying entrance fees, earning a grotesque ticket stub. After some garden gnome hijinks and resisting the non-Euclidean layout, the group tracked their pale dwarven rivals through magical archways, deciphered racist topiary, and braved aggressive, plantified handmaidens to reach Princess Larona. They learned she was cursed and her sister was the culprit, received lilies, loot, and a royal ring, and set out to return to Amberwood\u2014now contaminated, a little richer, and only slightly more traumatized by murderous horticulture.\n\n**Key Points** \n\n\n1. A new party sheet system was introduced for tracking inventory and distributing items and gold; all players now have access to a shared party inventory.\n2. When transferring items to the party sheet, players must manually delete the item from their own inventory to avoid duplicates.\n3. Craggy shattered a beheaded statue of an armored female dwarf, experiencing a vision where the statue whispered 'my sister' and winked at him; only Craggy witnessed this event.\n4. The statues in the garden had curses and graffiti in dwarvish, with items and candles present as if for an altar.\n5. The party became magically disoriented in the garden, returning to their starting point despite choosing a new direction, indicating the garden's shifting nature.\n6. Two undead dwarven gatekeepers demanded proof of entry ('ticket stub') from the dwarves in the party; Thrulrik paid 5 gold and received a magical ear as a ticket stub, which can be used to communicate with the gatekeepers.\n7. Gatekeepers reported that pale dwarves (interlopers) had recently jumped the east fence without paying and asked the party to report them if found.\n\n   \n    8. The party entered a lush garden with whimsical, semi-racist gnome statues that occasionally animate to interact with intruders.\n    9. Craggy determined the flowers in the garden were not eldritch lilies; the lilies the party seeks grow in water, while these were normal flowers in a raised bed.\n   10. Crossing garden thresholds caused magical disorientation, and the party felt the garden itself shift around them before emerging in a new area (topiary garden).\n   11. In the topiary garden, plant creatures sang a dwarvish lullaby and ignored the party, performing routine tasks like placing flowers in the fountain.\n   12. Quavence found clear evidence that eldritch lilies had been recently harvested from water basins (cut stems, missing flowers).\n   13. Thrulrik discovered muddy boot prints leading to a wall, where they abruptly ended with no sign of climbing or further tracks.\n   14. The party was confronted by a haze-twisted garden guard and knights, who deputized them as 'Garden Guard' and gave them a sealed letter to deliver to Princess Larona after seeing their ticket stub and hearing their intentions.\n   15. A gnome statue revealed that the pale dwarves had passed through and created a magical archway for the party after they asked politely, confirming the interlopers' path.\n   16. The party entered a central, opulent tiered garden with shimmering pools containing eldritch lilies and floating body parts, and statues of dwarven women in ball attire.\n   17. A sentient tree challenged the party, asking for the name of the princess's father (King Wisebeard) as proof of loyalty; Jorg answered correctly, and the tree opened the doors to a dwarven vault beneath the garden.\n   18. Craggy used Mage Hand to retrieve a ring from the vault's fountain, triggering an attack by handmaiden guardians\u2014plant-like dwarven women with eldritch lilies growing from their foreheads and snake-like hair.\n\n   \n   19. After defeating the handmaidens, the party collected 105 gold, a ring of evasion (given to Jorg), a silver goblet, and a flask of migrant bitters from the fountain.\n   20. The party found Princess Larona in a chamber filled with eldritch lilies; she had a lily growing from her forehead, purple eyes, webbed toes, and her mouth sewn shut, communicating telepathically with the party.\n   21. Larona revealed she is cursed by her unnamed sister, who seeks power through delirium and rules the ruins; only her sister can lift the curse, and Larona tasked the party with finding her and ending the curse, promising the gratitude and reward of the true dwarven kingdom if successful.\n   22. Larona gifted Thrulrik a ring of protection (signet ring with the migration symbol) and instructed the party to take the hidden eldritch lilies for their quest, as the pale dwarves had tried to steal them.\n   23. The party collected 5-6 lilies each, 250 gold, a jewelry box with 3 delirium crystals and 8 delirium shards, and several books, including 'Salt and Stone: A Genealogy of the Owlin' and 'Construct Automation Protocols'.\n   24. Craggy and Quavence each gained one level of contamination from exposure to the haze and contaminated water.\n   25. The party discussed plans to return to Amberwood to deliver the lilies, check on the knight captain, and pursue the quest to find Princess Larona's sister.\n\n[full_transcript.txt 132077](/api/attachments.redirect?id=5259bbed-07f0-40fa-97d0-8c9c39ae54d8)\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=edd870c8-3940-478d-a5b0-163841782a14 \" =1024x1024\")",

They do not seem to be affected much by the contamination, and travel with a heavily armed band of escorts. Nathaniel intones them to, \u201cJoin us on our pilgrimage\u201d to see the site of The Incident. He tells the party the contamination is not to be feared - but embraced - a gift from the gods.\n* Attempting to sneak back the way they came, they do come to a confrontation with the Executioner as they make a mad dash amongst the corpses in [Slaughterstone Square](https://s).\n\n## Summary\n\n**Recap** Craggy, Quavence, and Thrulrik escape from [Reed Manor](/doc/reed-manor-pg5IXCjPL0) with the unconscious mage [Rorsh](/doc/rorsh-the-mage-umxTjXQj7k), only to interrogate him for info about [Oscar](/doc/oscar-yoren-RFyn9kEyvc) and the elusive [eldritch lilies](/doc/eldritch-lily-B7ywkNMMT1). The party navigates the haze-choked ruins of Galmaarden, evading a menacing construct and barely surviving ambushes by gnolls and worgs\u2014Quavence even goes down and is revived, while Rorsh proves to be a surprisingly resilient (if mouthy) hostage. They tangle with cultists led by Nathaniel, loot some weird arcane items, and, after a desperate scramble involving shadows, more near-death moments, and a gnarly construct encounter, manage a harrowing escape back through the sewers to the [Black Ivory Inn](/doc/black-ivory-tavern-dwK4zxrboT). Everyone ends up battered, contaminated, but miraculously alive\u2014especially Quavence, who is in desperate need of a spa day and possibly a new face.\n\n\n1. **Key Points**\n\n   \n   1. We dragged Rorsch (human, early 30s, academy dropout) out of Reid Manor; he was unconscious but began to wake up as we exited.,\n   2. Quavence bound and gagged Rorsch to prevent spellcasting or insults; Rorsch briefly woke and used [Vicious Mockery](/doc/vicious-mockery-ClXBj5mK63) on Quavence before going limp again.,\n   3. We left the upstairs room in Reid Manor with a magical lock unexplored due to time pressure and zombies.,\n   4. Rorsch revealed Oscar Yoren is extremely secretive, keeps the [Expergo](/doc/aqua-expurgo-9ybF3xoHRi) formula in a coded notebook, and only allowed Rorsch to distill part of the formula (main ingredient: eldritch lilies).\n   5. Oscar Yoren fled with the last of the Expergo and the formula after our intrusion; Rorsch does not know Oscar's escape route or safehouse.,\n   6. Oscar's operation includes five people; three other mages were sent west to the Dwarven Botanical Garden to retrieve lilies, but expeditions often do not return.,\n   7. The lilies are located in the [Dwarven Botanical Garden](/doc/dwarven-botanical-garden-HCeR6G8Uhr) west of the city; the last mage expedition left the day before our arrival and is not expected back for another night or two.,\n   8. Rorsch has only been with Oscar for three months, rarely leaves the house, and does not know the exact location of the lilies or Queen's Park.\n\n   \n    9. Rorsch does not trust Oscar Yoren and hates him, but believes Oscar's experiments are brilliant and the cure is real.,\n   10. We decided to keep Rorsch alive and gagged, only to be released if he helps us find the lilies.,\n   11. The only known exit is via the tunnel at Slaughterstone Square, which is guarded by a large construct; the city wall is 50 feet tall and not easily climbed.,\n   12. We encountered the large construct near a ruined alchemist's shop; it activates and scans the area when disturbed by noise or movement.,\n   13. Craggy used Animate Objects to distract the construct, which smashed the cart and powered down, facing east; further distractions caused it to scan with a laser and attracted hay husks, which it ignored.,\n   14. We discovered a ruined square with a toppled statue, burning candles, and a well filled with blood and body parts; gnoll and worg tracks were identified.,\n   15. The party was ambushed by gnolls and worgs; Quavence was knocked unconscious but revived with a natural 20 on a death save.,\n   16. We found a spell scroll of [Intaglio](/doc/intaglio-THBJI8dd6y) and two healing potions on the gnoll and worg bodies, plus 175 gold (divided among the party).,\n   17. Nathaniel and his cultists, marked by a [delirium crystal](/doc/delirium-JlNwOH9FMQ), encountered us; Nathaniel claimed the cult has \"embraced\" the haze and sees it as a blessing, rejecting Oscar Yoren's cure as an abomination.,\n   18. Nathaniel implied his cult can resist or harness the haze's effects, but did not reveal any specific method or item for protection; their incense was familiar to Quavence but not magical.,\n   19. Quavence's contamination level is now 3, causing all healing from hit dice to be halved; he is visibly deteriorating (shaking hands, skin flaking), and cannot regain hit points from a long rest at level\n   20. We reviewed Oscar Yoren's coded notes (papers taken from the manor), confirming they are in code and may require River's help to decipher.\n   21. We returned to Slaughterstone Square and attempted to sneak past the construct; Craggy failed a stealth check, alerting the construct, which summoned six shadows and released necrotic gas.,\n   22. Quavence used his racial ability to become ethereal and escape, but suffered significant strength drain from shadow attacks; the party escaped through the tunnel beneath Slaughterstone Square and regrouped at the Black Ivory Inn.,\n   23. Party is grossly contaminated (Quavence at level 3), low on resources, but gained gold, a spell scroll of Intaglio, and Oscar Yoren's coded notes.\n\n\\\n",

Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage.\n\n***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d12 + 5) bludgeoning damage.\n\n***Alchemical Flame Jet (Recharge 5\u20136).*** The clockwork myrmidon can spew a jet of alchemical fire in a line 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Any creature in the path of the jet takes 26 (4d12) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The clockwork myrmidon can use this attack four times before its internal reservoir is emptied.\n\n***Grease Spray (Recharge 5\u20136).*** As a bonus action, the clockwork myrmidon's chest can fire a spray of alchemical grease with a range of 30 feet, covering a 10-by-10 foot square area and turning it into difficult terrain. Each creature standing in the affected area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. The clockwork myrmidon can use this attack four times before its internal reservoir is emptied.\n\n***Alchemical Fireball.*** The clockwork myrmidon's alchemical flame reservoir explodes when the construct is destroyed, spraying nearby creatures with burning fuel. A creature within 5 feet of the myrmidon takes 19 (3d12) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. This explosion doesn't occur if the clockwork myrmidon has already fired its alchemical flame jet four times.\n\n## Clockwork Myrmidon\n\nThis hulking brass and iron creature resembles a giant suit of plate armor; a constant growl issues from its midsection. It stands 9 feet tall and its squat head wears an angry expression. A clockwork myrmidon always moves with moves with a powerful, determined grace unusual in most clockwork creations.\n\n***Elite Machines.*** Clockwork myrmidons are heavily armored at their joints and at most vital parts. They are much too valuable to undertake patrols or menial labor, and they are unleashed only for dangerous situations that clockwork watchmen cannot handle.\n\n***Single Targets.*** A clockwork myrmidon defends itself but does not initiate combat unless so directed by its master. When it does enter battle, a clockwork myrmidon is unrelenting and single-minded, and it attacks one particular target until that foe surrenders, escapes, or is defeated.\n\nUnless given other instructions, a clockwork myrmidon attacks whatever enemy is closest to it. A clockwork myrmidon attacks until destroyed or ordered to stand down.\n\n***Alchemical Tricks.*** A clockwork myrmidon is always outfitted with alchemical fire, acids, grease, and other special devices. An alchemist is required to keep one running well.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] [Source: Tome of Beasts 1 page 64](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#clockwork%20myrmidon_tob)\n\n\\\n",

Often covered in thick fur, their colouration and features vary from hound-like to wolf-like, but all bear sharp teeth and claws. They form hyper-aggressive and predatory warpacks equipped with weapons taken from the many failed military attempts to reclaim the city. These beasts revel in their countless battles with adventurers and the Hooded Lanterns. The garmyr warpacks have made the Inner City their hunting ground, but have been sighted roving the countryside with increasing frequency. They live for the thrill of the hunt, and mock and taunt their prey as they chase them down. Though the warpacks are prone to infighting, a massive beast known as the **Lord of the Feast** rules the garmyr as their overlord, master, and god.\n\n\\\n\\\n",

River warned us about Frederick Von Lichten (the Pale Man), a rogue Academy wizard who experimented on initiates and spell hounds, went mad from the haze, and is rumored to still be alive in the city.,\n11. River emphasized caution when dealing with any mages inside the city walls, as not all wizards are trustworthy, even those claiming Academy ties.,\n12. The new local beer is being sold under the One-Eyed Mountain Brewery label, but the taste and style differ from Gilbert's original brews.,\n13. Filbert, claiming to be Gilbert's nephew, has reopened the brewery with help from 'cousins,' and has been making daily deliveries and visiting Gilbert's grave.,\n14. Harrowhark diagnosed Night Captain Theodore Marshall with early-stage lycanthropy; the curse is not yet permanent and can be cured before the next full moon (in about 12 days).\n\n**#13 Recap** After a hard-won victory the party\u2014Thrulrik, Craggy, Quavence, and Hydrax\u2014enjoys some rest in Emberwood Village at the Red Lion Inn. Post-reward from River and the Amethyst Academy, Quavence uses magical ointments (and 100gp) to heal some contamination, while his undead cat Chastroix joins the cast of companions. The group investigates a crime at the Skull & Sword tavern: barrels of ale stolen by suspects leaving a dwarfish threat in red paint\u2014\"Bound for Skullport.\" Clues and insults fly as the party traces the theft to suspicious, pale dwarves running the resurrected One Eyed Mountain Brewery, encountering escalating threats, evidence of magical crystals, and a plan involving the undercity. After eavesdropping with Chastroix and confirming a shady handoff, the party plans to stake out the brewery overnight, all while balancing dwarven politics, supply chain dramas, and excellent old lady beer chugging. Next session: a midnight pursuit of illicit ale!\n\n[full_transcript(1).txt 171236](/api/attachments.redirect?id=8368415b-408d-407a-8304-627f9ab5af22)\n\n\n 1. We received comped rooms at the Red Lion Inn, each with a brass Red Lion key, courtesy of the Amethyst Academy., River rewarded us for bringing Rorsh back alive and revealed some of the Amethyst Academy's goals and plans.\n 2. We received a secret note from River stating that Rorsh's enhanced interrogation is going well, and a partial recipe has been extracted, but eldritch lilies are needed for further research.,\n 3. A hidden message in the note revealed: \"The head mage, Eldritch Runeweaver, eagerly awaits your report. You shall have an audience with him if you are successful.\",\n 4. We have approximately twelve days until the fate of Theodore Marshall is decided.\n 5. The Skull and Sword tavern was vandalized: windows smashed, barrels of ale stolen, and \"Bound for Skullport\" written in red paint at dwarf height on the door. \n 6. Skullport is an old wive\u2019s tale, legendary or possibly real underground area beneath Gelmarden, associated with thieves and outcasts.,\n 7. Gorthar (the orc proprietor) suspects local dwarves and reports his last five barrels of One Eyed Mountain Brewery ale (Gilbert's legacy) were stolen.,\n 8. Gorthar's next ale shipment is late; he asks us to investigate the missing caravan.\n 9. The new brewery ownership is under someone named Filbert, allegedly Gilbert's nephew from Sturmhaven, but the party has not met him.,\n10. We encountered a group of pale dwarves with lilac/red eyes, ashen skin, and gray/white hair, accompanied by a Queen's Man with nationalist tattoos at the One Eyed Mountain Brewery.,\n11. The Queen's Man and his group are openly hostile, claim to be restoring the brewery for the Queen, and threaten us to pick sides, warning that the Queen will reclaim the city for dwarves.,\n12. The party suspects the pale dwarves may be connected to Skullport and/or using magic, which is unusual for Galmardan dwarves.,\n13. Blackjack Mel (with purple splotches from haze exposure) meets with a pale dwarf named Bardock (with a purple crystal in his head) in a private booth, guarded by armed dwarves.\n14. Quavence's cat overhears Bardock say, \"The Undercity is ready to join your cause if you can pay the price and bring in the supplies we need.\" Blackjack Mel replies, \"It has already begun, my friend. We'll bring you what you need tonight and make our delivery to the Undercity.\"\n15. The party decides to follow the cart carrying the barrels to discover the destination and gather more evidence about the antagonists' plans.\n\n\\\n",

These trees have the same statistics as a [treant](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#treant_mm), except they have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they can't speak, and they have only the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the treant. The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until the treant dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree; or until the treant takes a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root if possible.\n\n\n---\n\nTreants are awakened trees that dwell in ancient forests. Although treants prefer to while away the days, months, and years in quiet contemplation, they fiercely protect their woodland demesnes from outside threats.\n\n### The Sleeping Tree Awakens.\n\nA tree destined to become a treant meditates through a long cycle of seasons, living normally for decades or centuries before realizing its potential. Trees that awaken do so only under special circumstances and in places steeped with nature's magic. Treants and powerful druids can sense when a tree has the spark of potential, and they protect such trees in secret groves as they draw near the moment of their awakening. During the long process of awakening, a tree acquires face-like features in its bark, a division of the lower trunk into legs, and long branches bending downward to serve as its arms. When it is ready, the tree pulls its legs free from the clutching earth and joins its fellows in protecting its woodland home.\n\n### Legendary Guardians.\n\nAfter a treant awakens, it continues to grow exactly as it did when it was a tree. Treants created from the mightiest trees can reach great sizes while developing an innate magical power over plants and animals. Such treants can animate plants, using them to ensnare and trap intruders. They can call wild creatures to aid them or carry messages across great distances.\n\n### Protectors of the Wild.\n\nEven after awakening, a treant spends much of its time living as a tree. While rooted in place, a treant remains aware of its surroundings, and can perceive the effects of events taking place miles away based on subtle changes nearby.\n\nWoodcutters who avoid culling healthy living trees and hunters who take only what they need of the forest's bounty are unlikely to arouse a treant's ire. Creatures careless with fire, those who poison the forest, and those who destroy great trees, especially a tree close to awakening, face the treant's wrath.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Homebrew\n\n**Sources:** [MM, page 289](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#treant_mm)",

There is little, if anything, that a hungry owlbear fears. Even monsters that outmatch an owlbear in size and strength avoid tangling with it, for this creature cares nothing about a foe's superior strength as it attacks without provocation.\n\n#### Owlbear Origins. \n\nScholars have long debated the origins of the owlbear. The most common theory is that a demented wizard created the first specimen by crossing a giant owl with a bear. However, venerable elves claim to have known these creatures for thousands of years, and some fey insist that owlbears have always existed in the Feywild.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Homebrew\n\n**Sources:** [Basic Rules SRD, page 147](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#owlbear_mm)",

      "content": "### In Our Current Campaign\n\n> The diminutive little people, gnomes live below ground and guard their homeland with a jealous secrecy that few have glimpsed. Their dealings with the civilizations above ground is limited to trade, where they are known for intricate craftsmanship and ingenious devices. Some gnomes have come to live on the surface and assimilate to human life - known as halflings - as in half-humans.\n\n### Gnome Traits\n\nYour gnome character has certain characteristics in common with all other gnomes.\n\n***Ability Score Increase***. Your Intelligence score increases by 2.\n\n***Age***. Gnomes mature at the same rate humans do, and most are expected to settle down into an adult life by around age 40. They can live 350 to almost 500 years.\n\n***Alignment***. Gnomes are most often good. Those who tend toward law are sages, engineers, researchers, scholars, investigators, or inventors. Those who tend toward chaos are minstrels, tricksters, wanderers, or fanciful jewelers. Gnomes are good-hearted, and even the tricksters among them are more playful than vicious.\n\n***Size***. Gnomes are between 3 and 4 feet tall and average about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.\n\n***Speed***. Your base walking speed is 25 feet.\n\n***Darkvision***. Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\n***Gnome Cunning***. You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.\n\n***Languages***. You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish. The Gnomish language, which uses the Dwarvish script, is renowned for its technical treatises and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural world.\n\n## Rock Gnome\n\nAs a rock gnome, you have a natural inventiveness and hardiness beyond that of other gnomes.\n\n***Ability Score Increase***. Your Constitution score increases by 1.\n\n***Stone Tea*.** You have proficiency with your [Gnomish Tea Set](/doc/gnomish-tea-set-HrqDVlit6V). Gnomes and halflings who come from Underdark society know the secret of the Stone Tea brew, and an individual with a week\u2019s preparation time and the proper ingredients can summon enough magic to imbue a single tea ceremony ritual with [Stone Shape](/doc/stone-shape-Ni4NXltKR3). However, Stone Tea is known to induce erratic behavior individuals who are regularly exposed to sunlight.\n\n***Artificer's Lore***. Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you can add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you normally apply.\n\n***Tinker***. You have proficiency with artisan's tools (tinker's tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time.\n\nWhen you create a device, choose one of the following options:\n\n***Clockwork Toy***. This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.\n\n***Fire Starter***. The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.\n\n***Music Box***. When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song's end or when it is closed.",

A tall, blonde man known for his fairness, good character, and generosity. He mysteriously disappeared on a hunting trip in the [Dreadwood](/doc/dreadwood-GcfKdBzGyT), leaving behind his son [Anders](/doc/anders-solmor-njTKn6ITMV) to carry on the family business and take his seat on the [Saltmarsh Council](/doc/saltmarsh-council-8KxfpMfTQ0).\n\nIt was revealed that his disappearance was actually the result of a betrayal by the witch [Amelia](/doc/amelia-mAibH1T0Em), and he had been turned into one of [Lady Nightshade](/doc/lady-nightshade-3kjLNj2Zbs)\u2019s [vampire](/doc/vampire-K6MjtAPLqz) knights.\n\n## Undeath\n\nIn undeath he was known and feared by many names: *The Antlered One, The Dark Druid, The Knight of Night.* \n\nHe also used his shapechanging nature to infiltrate Saltmarsh - [Skerrin Wavechaser](/doc/skerrin-wavechaser-sCnR3QOnff) is one such identity, undoubtedly there were others.\n\nTurned into a [vampire](/doc/vampire-K6MjtAPLqz) by the [Lady Nightshade](/doc/lady-nightshade-3kjLNj2Zbs), he ran an underground plantation in the perpetual twilight beneath [the Sunless Temple](/doc/sunless-temple-yS5i3gqWiO). Using the souls of the dragonborn who died in the temple as slave labor, he produced large amounts of [Sapphire Nightshade](/doc/sapphire-nightshade-Qvbjiqksvy) for an unknown purpose.\n\n## Death\n\nA party of adventurers from the [Gold Scale Company](/doc/gold-scale-company-m1WdlmIYwP), accompanied by a brave gnome named [Meepo](/doc/meepo-UMrKyHk53I), tracked Solmar into his lair and killed him.\n\n# Encounters\n\nThe party was attacked by his antlered vampiric form in the [old mine](/doc/the-old-mine-ndIfgvk1B6), where [they found a watch](/doc/session-11-plots-under-the-mountain-5QCSooTv6K) engraved with \u201cL. Solmor\u201d. [Greyson](/doc/greyson-adams-0y5qoKwfDR) returned it to Anders.\n\nThey encountered him again aboard the [Dragon\u2019s Jubilee](/doc/session-15-16-murder-on-the-jubilee-b5dYJiJkGZ) - where he had taken the form of Ander\u2019s advisor, [Skerrin Wavechaser](/doc/skerrin-wavechaser-sCnR3QOnff) and tried to [poison](/doc/nightshade-poison-rGISMbm8AA) the passengers. He escaped in the chaos of the sahuagin assault on Saltmarsh.\n\nThe party eventually tracked him into the depths below the Sunless Temple, where he met his end.",

I always have a plan for what to do when things go wrong. I\u2019m used to helping out those who aren\u2019t as smart as I am, and I patiently explain anything and everything to others, usually in the form of a song. I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy.\n\n### **Ideals:**\n\nMusic makes the world go round. Hospitality is the essence of generosity and perception. There are no problems, only solutions. People. I\u2019m loyal to my friends, not to any ideals, and everyone else can take a trip down the Styx for all I care. (Neutral) Redemption. There\u2019s a spark of good in everyone. (Good)\n\n### **Bonds**\n\nMy mother has always cared for me and supported me financially\n\n### **Flaws**\n\nI ask for ludicrous things, and most of the time I am successful. Except when I am not. \\nIf there\u2019s a plan, I\u2019ll forget it. If I don\u2019t forget it, I\u2019ll ignore it, unless I made it.\n\n# Background Story\n\nI was raised by my Elf mother and step father in the Elfin citadel of [Doral](/doc/doral-7CPHFPqsXA). I had a normal childhood, you could say. As a half-elf the other kids were kind of confused by me. I took their confusion and shaped it into admiration, leading herds of screaming elf children into all kind of shenanigans. I was always singing songs to pass the time while my mother worked with her spells and potions. Aside from the occasional scuffle between the elders, things were pretty peaceful. As a teen I began to ask questions about my father, and of course my mother was hesitant to tell me. Eventually I convinced her to share what little she remembered about him. He was a druid, so I mean, how bad could he be right? With just his name and a few pieces of information I set out to find him. My mother begged me not to go, but I was 20, it's not like I was a child or anything, at least by human standards! Mother is always forgetting about my human side.\u00a0 I found my father four years later in a swampy land far from home. He was (and is) an Acolyte of [Ching Hai](/doc/ching-hai-yoiW7rLxlV), a vegan druid, hellbent on protecting all animals from harm. Her people called themselves the [Celestia De Lamour](/doc/celestia-de-lamour-w5YwcY3B29), and have pledged their lives and service to her and her cause. At first it was easy to get swept up in the beautiful community that surrounded my father and welcomed me with open \\*human\\* arms. They didn't see me as a child, instead they saw my potential. They taught me to be an evangelist for the cause, and in doing so helped me build my skills in persuasion, performance, and deception. I loved it. \n\nOne day my father came to me and asked me to go on a special mission to collect three rare serpents from the jungle south of our village. He told me that these serpents needed to be protected from the people who were abusing them for their powers. He promised they would be safer in the care of Ching Hai. Long story short,\u00a0 those people REALLY LOVED those snakes, and after trying to deceive them, charm them, maim them\u2026 well honestly I should have died. When faced with the choice to take one of the serpents or save me as I lay crushed under a burning cauldron, the Celestia followers chose the snake. I will never forget the look of pained satisfaction on my fathers face as he scurried away, leaving me writhing in the dirt under the burning metal. I survived only because a passing Cleric took pity on me, dragged me by my feet to safety, and nursed me back to health. Without Olryssa I wouldn\u2019t be here. I call that the season of my life \u201cthe wake up call\u201d I wrote a song about it actually.\u00a0 \n\nWith the Celestia assuming I was dead, I took the opportunity to start over, I hiked my way out of the jungle and charmed my way onto a boat, crossed the Azure Sea, and landed in beautiful Seaton. My Seaton season, if you will. That's where I met him. The man that ruined my life and broke my heart. Drogarius \"Dro\" Edwardian Vitorio Vardendale. I only tell you his full name because I want you to watch out ladies!\u00a0 Well, as you may or may not have realized by now, I do love a challenge. That's obviously why I fell head over buttocks for the half Elf Monk with Roguish aspirations. The man was the bane of my existence. After more than twenty years of the whole \u201cwill he or won\u2019t he\u201d thing (he mostly did) I tired of being second to the Arch Fey. I left Dro a poetic goodbye and set off on a walkabout. I have been walking all over the world ever since. Maybe, one of these days I will circle back to Dro\u2026 if he\u2019s still alive. Only time will tell.\u00a0 My connection to my mother remains strong and she is always sending me little trinkets and things to help me along my travels. \n\nHumans make so much fuss about \u201cpurpose\u201d and \u201cmeaning\u201d and \u201cgetting rich by turning stone into gold\u201d (BORING) but I don\u2019t care for such things. I long to understand the earth around me, to bring joy to people\u2019s hearts and find reasons to celebrate. I don\u2019t really understand why all this darkness abounds. I\u2019m 65 years young and I plan on having the best time, all the time, until the day I die. I know when others look at me they probably think \u201coh richie-rich-hippie-dippy elf touched girl\u201d \u2026and they\u2019re not wrong. But I have a few more tricks up my sleeve.\u00a0 On my latest walkabout, I cleared out a haunted island, fought off two dozen squishy blue sea zombies, and after killing a big, ugly, magical bird, I was gifted my Staff of the Woodlands. Well, by gifted I do mean that I took it from a wizard, but you\u2019ll just have to trust me when I say I earned it.\u00a0",

The early days of the colonial period were characterized by several centuries of so-called \u201c[Short Wars](/doc/short-wars-the-wars-begin-KRy7NuxEEY)\u201d with the indigenous population of [gnomes](/doc/gnome-ARFvDASnZz) there, led by [Adalind Rumblebelly](/doc/adalind-rumblebelly-SLXdYH518j).\n\n### Wasteland & Junk Gang Wars\n\nAfter the migration of the dwarves, the city became unstable and wild magic erupted in the area. Scavengers and squatters fight amongst the ruins for whatever scraps they can find. An arcane explosion known as *The Incident* unleashes widespread eldritch contamination in area. The junk gangs organize into rival factions, making excursions into the increasingly dangerous city beset by *The Haze* and monstrous horrors that wander the streets.\n\n ![Galmaarden after \"The Incident\"](/api/attachments.redirect?id=31c26cda-9b9c-4f4f-8c72-a7f1e7f131c9 \" =900x900\")\n\n### Dragonborn & The New City\n\n*The New City* was founded by [Razorback](/doc/razorback-the-uniter-O3oe7NBQqK) the Uniter, who led the original settlements of dragonborn ex-conscripts after his successful rebellion against the [Dragon Empire](/doc/dragon-empire-odzVqtQPbm). They began the work of rebuilding the ravaged city as a place of equals where \u201cevery citizen is a king.\u201d\n\n# Organization\n\nNew Galmaarden is organized from the bottom up, in a web of interlocking and overlapping neighborhood councils, trade unions, volunteer groups, gangs, cooperatives, and affinity groups. No one group or person is in charge, and each group differs in their ideology, goals, and internal organization. Many of these groups are the descendants of junk gang factions from the Wasteland years.\n\n\n:::info\n*See also:* [New Galmaarden Civil Society](/doc/new-galmaarden-civil-society-AjPbwTWHao)\n\n:::\n\n### Spokescouncil\n\n ![Democratic decision making in The New City](/api/attachments.redirect?id=e0f50522-8fab-4dc8-8aae-0f77bb48f201)When decisions involving entire neighborhoods, industries, or even the whole city need to be made, temporary representatives - called Spox - of each stakeholding group are sent to a central [Spokescouncil](https://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/spokescouncil). Spox find like minded groups to elect a Spoke amongst them, who will press their interests before the Spokescouncil. The Spokescouncil must come to a consensus that everyone can live with.\n\n### Social Order\n\nAs the city has no jails, police, or formal courts communal decisions and the general order are enforced through social pressure, with bad actors or rogue groups shunned from civil society and excluded from the city\u2019s networked life. \n\n[The Silver Suns](/doc/the-silver-suns-Qtggev16EG) are traditionally the main organization that mediate day-to-day conflicts and antisocial behavior. Serious cases, like murder, are raised to the stakeholding councils and the offender is tried by their peers. Penalties are usually restitution, social exclusion, or in the very worst cases - exile.\n\n# Timeline\n\n[https://lucid.app/lucidchart/74692c15-0e78-4def-926e-c9a20914ddd3/view](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/74692c15-0e78-4def-926e-c9a20914ddd3/view)\n\n\\\n",

A [sahuagin necromancer](/doc/crowbar-rotfin-zCYEaTtSxP) sees the carnage and resurrects the fallen band as undead to do his bidding and to try to beat the lizardfolk again, using the rotting corpses of his comrades. \\n  \\n The conflict takes place among the strange, frozen ruins that have emerged from the ocean depths. They teem with both monsters and treasures, agitated by the total lunar eclipse that happens to fall on this night.\n\n# Scenario\n\n\u201cThe eclipse has already started as the game begins. Due to the failing sunlight, the maximum line-of-sight on the first turn of the game is 16\u201d. No shooting attack or spell may have a target beyond this distance. At the beginning of each turn, the city grows darker, and the maximum line-of-sight is reduced by 1\u201d. This continues until the moon fully blocks the sun in a total eclipse, which occurs when the maximum line-of-sight reaches 12\u201d (the fifth turn of the game). After this turn, the maximum line-of-sight will increase by 1\u201d every turn for the rest of the game.\n\nOn the fifth turn, when the eclipse is total, there is a massive surge of magic throughout the city. Any spellcaster attempting to cast a spell on this turn receives +6 on his casting roll.\u201d\n\n# Battle Report\n\nThe lizardfolk start off with a serious advantage, unearthing a treasure very close to their side of the ruins. The lizard thief runs in to stake their claim, while the wizard casts Arcane Eye and takes an arrow in the process.\n\nThe necromancer gets a fast start, casting Fleet Feet and rushing the board. He also casts Beauty, to cover his rotting face with the visage of a dazzling beautiful man. The thief Juliana Scarface almost lays her hands on the treasure, but Mind Control from the lizard wizard tells her to jump straight to her death from the top of the bridge. What seemed an initial advantage in position for the necromancer is not going well.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=2383af96-9517-4801-ba4a-d33149ba9833)\n\nOn the other side of the ruins, in what is left of a stone house, two bands of thiefs and apprentices battle over a treasure. The lizardfolk treasure hunter initially gets the goods, but is quickly surrounded by the fast moving undead thieves and their Shadow warhound, who is extremely difficult to hit. The apprentices trade spell attacks but have limited range because of the eclipse. Finally the tide is turned when the lizardfolk gets Mind Control on the thieves and is able to break up the brawl and make a run for it. The lizardfolk gain another treasure and decimate the necromancers band by fighting his own minions against each other.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=003a6692-92d6-41ec-9396-41e5a6c59c5c)\n\nUnfortunately a Minor Demon appears in the lizardfolk arrow which causes them to rethink their plan. It engages one of the lizardfolk\u2019s best fighters, and they parry each other for many rounds. \n\nThe necromantic apprentice, Bonehead, uses this as an opportunity to attack but blows himself up in an epic magical fail.\n\nZazok goes down in a hail of arrow fire from the remaining necromantic archers, and the Necromancer himself is overcome soon after. \n\nThe eclipse has completed and what remains of each warband retreat, with the lizardfolk taking the majority of the treasure.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=650300fe-97dc-4872-affd-775508e52d15)",

The air is thick with the scent of smoldering hearth fires and bubbling pots of stew. The structure itself is a massive lean-to of dark, gnarled wood reaching up to support a much patched canvas tarp strung across for shelter. Dimly lit by flickering torches, the interior buzzes with the hushed tones of its inhabitants.\\n\n>\n> Outside you leave behind the mighty treant that overshadows Burle as it continues its endless lament, shedding leaves that fall like a slow, melancholic rain. The townsfolk move about with a reverent unease, their eyes often turning towards the ailing titan, their faces etched with concern. Among the ramshackle structures that lean precariously against each other are damp and sad looking camps of the displaced from [Saltmarsh](/doc/saltmarsh-GkGI6ISio5), sprung up like colorful mushrooms wherever they fit.\\n\n>\n> In the longhouse, the life and rumor mill of the town hums in it\u2019s smoky interior. To your left, a group of cloaked figures converse in low, urgent whispers, their eyes glinting secretively as they deal out cards amongst themselves. To your right, a vendor in a tattered, dark hooded cloak displays curious artifacts that seem to twist and shimmer in the dim light.  \\n\\nStraight ahead of you, a [ravenfolk](/doc/ravenfolk-2FqUStq1FR) fortune teller sits at a table, cards laid out, baubles and shiny things attached to their feathers glinting in the candle light. It calls out to you in a voice you recognize as familiar, someone from town, with the faint lilt of birdsong\u2026. \u201cCome, sit friend\u2026\u201d \n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=6d435fcc-59aa-4789-96a0-45d9396ce091 \"right-50\")Greyson approaches the fortune teller and sits. The bird-woman speaks in perfect mimicry of Greyson\u2019s old friend [Math](/doc/math-hammerhammer-UmczDtj1Da), but seeing recognition in his eyes she switches to the clear voice of a very young child. \u201cLet us see what is in the cards for you\u2026\u201d\n\nGreyson draws a card.\n\nSwitching to the raspy voice of an old man: \n\n> \u201c*Behold, the **Nine of Cups**, a vessel of fulfillment and contentment. This card speaks of wishes granted, but be forewarned, for desires fulfilled may bear a hidden thorn. [The Dark Temple](/doc/sunless-temple-yS5i3gqWiO) offers what you seek, but at what cost? Seek your riches, but guard your souls, lest this place claims more than you intend to give as tolls.\u201d*\n\nThe party moves on looking for magic items and supplies. An elfmarked ranger dresses an owlbear hanging from the ceiling, with her bloody hands she displays several tempting magic items. An old man with a scarred and weeping eye fletches arrows and offers weapons. A drunk dwarf dispenses terrible ale and rumors - that a party of \u201cgreen adventurers\u201d passed through recently and it\u2019s almost time to call in the bets on whether they\u2019ll return or not. When the party asks more about the guildsman and their methods, the dwarf gets visibly nervous, \u201cPeople don\u2019t exactly hire them to go boar hunting\u2026.\u201d\n\nThe party sees a community board with notes scribbled out, posting for things lost, and an entire section devoted to gambling on whether or not adventure parties will return. A signed note for \u201cThe Green Avengers\u201d is annotated with their odds - they\u2019re not good.\n\nTwo dirty mothers, obviously displaced from Saltmarsh and dressed in rags, tug at Bahruhn\u2019s sleeve. \u201cSir, have you seen my child? They went missing while foraging mushrooms\u2026\u201d she presses a poorly rendered charcoal drawing into his hand. The other woman says, \u201cMine is Esther, and hers is Nelson. They haven\u2019t been seen in 3 days, and we don\u2019t have the money to hire the hunter\u2019s guild.\u201d\n\n## The Treant\n\nThe party steps out of the longhouse and into the narrow, muddy streets of Burle. The leaves of the old, ailing [treant](/doc/treant-DMoj3FKaOe) fall like rain. Refugees shovel them into their sad, smoky camp fires. The party approaches the massive tree, and Ama uses her magic to wake and speak with him. The Treant only responds in riddles in a thundering voice:\n\n> * *Born from a seed, destined to tower. In life, a home, in death, a bower. I give so much, yet now I take. What is my fate, for the forest's sake?*\n> * *Deep beneath the earth, I seek secrets old. Twisting and turning, I grasp at tales untold.*\n> * *Seek where roots delve deep and old, Where tales of shifting stones are told. Only by the light of a moonless gaze, Will you find the sunless maze.*\n\nAma places her hand on the treant and it comes away wet with red blood.\n\n## Hunter\u2019s Guild\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=c5d362ea-15dc-4fa1-b436-f766b2f8f9bb \"left-50\")One of the only buildings that doesn\u2019t seem temporary in Burle, the party approaches the sturdy log cabin of the [Hunter\u2019s Guild Lodge](/doc/burle-hunters-guild-TFqCs3pSJy). Various notices are tacked beneath the brass symbol of the guild - a great tree watching over a pack of hounds.\n\nThe party pushes open the heavy wooden door, inside a large hearth fire burns casting long shadows across the walls covered in taxidermied trophies. At a large circular table, several guildsman are playing cards near the fire. As the party enter, several dogs get up and sniff at their boots.\n\nA man that Greyson recognizes calls out \u201cHail and well met, how can we assist you friend?\u201d It\u2019s [Saxton Pope](/doc/saxton-pope-CJaIQ4Kkdw), the fur trader he met at the feast. \u201cYou are welcome at our fire - I saw you fight the sahuagin that terrible night\u2026\u201d\n\nThe party inquires for information about the \u201cGreen Avengers\u201d and the temple they were after, or if the guildsmen know anything about the missing child or \u201cshifting stones\u201d. After some negotiation over the fee, one of the guides, a man named [Eldan Fletcher](/doc/eldan-fletcher-QWyA10eG7I) agrees to take them but it will have to wait until morning.\n\n# The Sunless Temple\n\nThe party goes back to the longhouse to make their preparations, when the market is interrupted by two guildsmen dragging in a bloodied man wearing a ripped green cloak. \u201cMake way and clear the table! Someone call a doctor or a wizard!\u201d \n\nAma walks over and lays hands on him, healing him enough to bring him back to consciousness briefly. \u201c*I ran and ran\u2026 they were hunting me\u2026 I saw death himself - he wore a crown of antlers..*\u201d\n\nThe party demands the guildsmen take them to where they found him, and Eldan agrees to show them the way. But not before the locals begin taking bets on whether this party, the Gold Scale Co, will come back\u2026\n\nEldan leads them into the woods, over a stream that flows backwards up a waterfall, and to a tree with a sword embedded in it, surrounded by 3 stones. Eldan instructs them, \u201cWatch and do exactly as I do.\u201d He walks counterclockwise around the tree twice, tapping the stones, and then he vanishes.\n\nThe party feels space and time shift and they find themselves stepping out of the thick woods into a clearing. A giant sinkhole, maybe a mile around, has opened in the earth and swallowed part of the forest.\n\nA gnarled tree leans over the edge - one branch has caught a small bit of green fabric. A narrow ledge leads down into the darkness.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=214d98e2-a828-46fd-a869-d2865ee55f3c \"left-50\")The party descends and the ledge becomes a staircase. At a sandy spot they stop and see a dark temple half buried in the rubble below. Then they are ambushed [by brains with furry legs and bald tails like rats](/doc/swarm-of-cranium-rats-C8soW8rXRX). They scamper out and attempt to focus their brain magic on the party, but they are squashed. The brain-rats swarm and wrap themselves into one, huge, writhing mass of rat, but Grey jumps from the ledge above and body slams them, sending brain matter flying into the abyss below.\n\n# Into the Dungeon\n\nAt the base of the staircase, the party finds themselves in a courtyard. The temple is [imperial draconic](/doc/dragon-empire-odzVqtQPbm), towers carved into the shapes of dragons. In the center of this courtyard a stone gallows stands, surrounded by a mountain of dragonborn skeletons. The party picks their way through to the great stone entrance.\n\nAma uses her new [Wand of Secrets](https://5e.dungeon.church/items.html#wand%20of%20secrets_dmg), and it outlines a pit trap directly in front of the door. Carefully activating the trap without being sucked in, they see the pit is full of [Gelatinous Cubes](/doc/gelatinous-cubes-MrmgOerhQO). Several skeletons are entombed within. Ama uses her mage hand to fish out a few trinkets. The party devises to jump across this pit using their animated rope and some pitons.\n\nOnce inside they find themselves in a circular tower with several doors. Two Ama sees a butterfly floating through the ruins. She casts [Locate](https://5e.dungeon.church/spells.html#locate%20animals%20or%20plants_phb) to see if there are more, and feels only one certain sense: Down, deeper into the earth. The smoke from her ritual leads her to one of the three passages: a dark hallway.\n\nAfter freeing a [steam elemental](/doc/steam-elemental-RsvOfpU21i) from a water boiler, the party pushes inward to the temple and finds a disheveled room with a large, broken steel cage. Weeping in a bedroll they find [Meepo](/doc/meepo-UMrKyHk53I), a gnome who tells them he was supposed to \u201cwatch over the clan\u2019s dragon, but ghosts came in the night and freed it and the clan thinks it\u2019s my fault\u201d. After some consolation, the party assures him they can help so he says he will bring them to his queen. Calling out the safe word - `\u201cTICKLECORN!!\u201d` he leads them through darkened dungeon passages into a grand pillared hall.\n\n# Gnomes Work\n\nThe leader of this clan of gnomes is a woman named [Yusdrayl](/doc/yusdrayl-JyU80S0S6K), surrounded by guards armed with wicked swords made of a pink crystal. On the altar next to Yusdrayl is a black pyramid with strange magical ruins swimming across it\u2019s surface - [Greyson knows it](https://lore.dungeon.church/doc/session-12-13-the-forge-of-fury-m1dOelbiNy#h-the-deal) immediately. Averting his gaze from the black relic he addresses Yusdrayl and offers help.  The gnomish queen explains that monsters and ghosts are making their way from this place into their [Underdark](/doc/underdark-Lu1sEFgEWw) tunnels, and their work was almost complete until the dragon wyrmling was lost by [Meepo](/doc/meepo-UMrKyHk53I). The blood of an alive dragon is needed for their ritual, and dragon wyrmlings are very difficult to come by these days.\n\nShe offers a dragon key to \u201cdeeper chambers\u201d if the players can retrieve the dragon despite the \u201cresistance\u201d encountered, otherwise her clan would just seal the tunnels. Greyson deftly palms his magical [Skeleton Key](/doc/skeleton-key-aCKEViKMZf), and pretending to admire the craftsmanship of the relic he makes his own copy without anyone noticing. They ask what\u2019s below and she simply says, \u201cWhen the Black One walks through from below, we avoid him.\u201d\n\n# Deeper Chambers\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=53d7d7d7-abc7-4f01-9693-cb59a8292459 \"left-50\")Meepo leads the party safely through some traps, and they pass through chambers lined with iron shackles on the walls. In a large hall to the north, eldritch fire burns in the torch sconces and the party is attacked by Dragonborn [poltergeists](/doc/poltergeists-UdVS1rLmud), still bound in their iron chains. They ambush and attack, passing through walls and flying through and past the party, damaging them with their eldritch breath. Once they realize that only magical attacks connect with their incorporeal forms, they quickly put them back to rest.\n\nGray Rivermoon, raging and hungry for more fighting, throws himself at a door, kicking it in. \n\nInside, they find a very angry dragon wyrmling\u2026\n\n\n---\n\n*( until next time\u2026 )* ",

They shout in their guttural shark-tongue, and raise their tridents to attack.\n\nThe players take their positions and begin to fight back, but the newly acquired weapons they took shatter almost immediately upon impact with their enemies. The weapons aren\u2019t prized dwarven treasures, but inferior counterfeits.\n\nThe sahuagin move in, eyes glowing, at the mostly unarmed party. The situation seems dire. The sahuagin attempt to grapple them and pull them toward the raging water that drains into a deadly looking hole, until\u2026.\n\nKrack busts out the gemstone she acquired, and summons a [Water Elemental](/doc/water-elemental-bTU955NLVY) to fight alongside them. The sahuagin, confused, jump at it and attack, with one ending up inside it swimming. The others are quickly smashed by it\u2019s overwhelming might, and the party it saved by it\u2019s watery punches.\n\nThey examine the corpses of the sahuagin who did not escape and find a stone key, of dwarven make\u2026.\n\n# Krack\u2019s Vision\n\nThe party takes a long rest to recover, and while asleep Krack has a vision.\n\n> She dreams of a pulsating crystal, being surrounded by the sounds of moths beating their wings and a soothing, baritone voice that tells her, \u201cDon\u2019t touch it, not yet, you must learn to control it first\u2026. you are close\u2026\u201d\n\nTharac nods awake to see Krack floating about 3 feet in the air, held up by nothing he can see.\n\n# The Door Opens\n\nThe party retraces their steps, making their way through the largest cavern. They hear the sounds of the lizards scraping their claws on the rocks around them, and their stench pervades the air. The party makes a run for it, the [lizards](/doc/lizards-TMNgqcB7LH) pursue. They make it to the door and thrust the key in, will it turn? The great stone door opens, and the party slips inside just in time to evade their invisible pursuers, who scratch at the door.\n\nThey make their way up a staircase, and trigger a [Magic Mouth](/doc/magic-mouth-u6HmPDk6fp) alarm: \u201cINTRUDER ALERT! INTRUDER ALERT!\u201d the stone lips call out before disappearing. Whatever lies ahead knows they are coming.\n\nAt the top of the stairs they find 3 huge dwarven statues, with two doors in the wall. Greyson approaches to try the lock, but as soon as he touches it he realizes the door is fake. Something clicks in the giant statue, and the arm of the statue comes crashing down with it\u2019s hammer, striking him squarely.\n\nAfter a more careful examination, they realize there is a hidden passage to the east. Behind the third statue, a secret door slides way to bring them into a firelit grand hall.. they hear the banging hammers of a forge at work\u2026\n\n# Gnomes in the Throne Room\n\nThey enter a massive, grand hall that once must have been majestic - now decrepit and covered in graffiti. It\u2019s many stone columns, carved in the shapes of dragons, reach to a high ceiling that showcases now faded frescoes of dwarven history. Torches adorned to each column light the way to the far end of the room, where the dwarf throne still stands, a door behind it slightly ajar.  Many doors lead out of this main hall, and it is obvious by the sounds of workmen that the forge lies to the south of them, behind guarded door. On the throne is some sort of gnome warlord and his guards, who all have the the strange, translucent look of gnomes who have never seen the sun. \n\nThe party steps inside and all of the sudden [hears whistling everywhere around them](/doc/hand-of-adalind-kFepjGY6vb). Two [gnomes](/doc/gnome-ARFvDASnZz) suddenly fade into vision out of nothing, with weapons drawn. They seem particularly agitated to see Math, who is wearing the armor he stole off the [Iron Rider](/doc/iron-riders-of-abraxas-P77pTaxjou). The party notices that there are several dead Iron Riders\u2019 corpses still left on the floor, covered in blood and arrows. One of the gnomes snaps off a potion from his tactical belt and quaffs it - he immediately quadruples in size, becoming a giant. It is clear that there are many invisible gnomes all around them, and they have been anticipating the party to walk through the door. Math assures them he is no rider, and the gnomes push them off to the side and say \u201cDo not interfere with our work here. If you are just adventurers, go raid the other rooms (he spits on the ground) and take whatever dwarf crap you want. We don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=521d931b-09c8-43dc-a020-f902ee5cdd10)\n\n# The Dwarven Colony\n\nThe party checks out the sprawling dwarven passages, first looking into a room to the south, and finding a kitchen full of [animated furniture](/doc/animated-furniture-Pt41sK9mJc) that throws itself at them. They regroup and again watch the gnomes at work - familiar looking crates are dragged out of the forge room, and the gnome leader comes down to inspect them.\n\nThe party goes through a door to the north and finds a defiled dwarven chapel, with sloppy graffiti on the walls and the furniture in disarray. As the party approaches the altar a wraith appears and attacks. They flee into further hallways with many doors, which they begin to kick in and dust and weak, undead [skeletons](/doc/skeleton-ScNMTHQhwp). \n\nAt the end of the hall they come to a room with a well, long filled in with gunk and decay. They hear a ghostly voice call out, \u201cWhere is it? Where is my precious? I feel myself fading from this world\u2026 I have guarded it for so long\u2026\u201d\n\nThe party comes across an apparition of a dwarf [ghost](/doc/ghost-YHwND9y9uG), wandering the halls. He appears to be some sort of sorcerer. He tells the party that he was bound to keep watch over his [precious crystal](/doc/magic-crystal-olmEylyxjb) for eternity, but he failed and feels himself slipping from the material realm. They ask him another question, but he fades into nothing.\n\nFurther into the dwarven passageways they find a dusty armory, and get entangled with some [animated armor](/doc/animated-armor-GQNiKMSlpD) that lurks there. They finally make their way to a library, where candles are lit, and [Amelia](/doc/amelia-mAibH1T0Em) is reading a book on the [Dragon Emperors](/doc/dragon-empire-odzVqtQPbm). She looks up from her tome and says, \u201cAh I remember those days so well even though it was so long ago. Such an interesting time!\u201d Math seethes with rage at her, and finally she wishes the party good luck in their little dungeon delve. She turns into a bat and flies away.\n\n# The Ritual\n\nThey check out the last passage, where a lonely gnome stand guard half asleep outside a door. He recognizes the party and asks them, \u201cYou knew [Pants](/doc/panteleon-thorngage-9YcdfHf4au)?\u201d when the party assures him they did, and if they can see what lies beyond, their new gnome friend named Sani Hoogle tells them \u201cDon\u2019t disturb the ritual\u2026\u201d\n\nThey look into the room and watch as the gnomes chant and pass a [mushroom tea](/doc/stone-tea-ik79CS5iIM) between them. They each sip, and each chant louder, and one by one stand and begin to walk in a circle, faster and faster. They somehow merge into one terrible entity, a circle with no head or tail, just movement. The circle breaks and this blur of frenzied gnomes dives head first into the rock and travels through it as if it were water. The fire crackles in the now empty room.\n\n# The Deal\n\nThe party retraces their steps to find the throne room a hive of activity. Gnome crews are climbing the columns and setting up explosives. It is quite clear they are preparing to leave and destroy this place behind them. They see more gnomes filtering into the room behind the throne - the ritual room - and not coming out.\n\nThe gnomish leader is standing in the center of all this, now facing a squadron of sahuagin warriors led by a [priestess sorcerer](/doc/sahuagin-priestess-mKq549Zsqa). They are standing around the crates of weapons as the sahuagin inspect them. Krack sneaks forward in the shadows to try to hear what they say.\n\nThe sahuagin speaks: \u201cLast order, we agree. Korel keep word. Our offering, a gift from [The One Who Sleeps in the Sea](/doc/proteus-Apiz4CreFn).\u201d\n\nHe pulls from his cloak a small, [black pyramid](/doc/collector-of-souls-XA0hpJ7gfE). On it\u2019s glossy, ebony surface intricate symbols and patterns swirl and shift across it.\n\nThe gnome leader says, \u201cLikewise, until we meet again.\u201d and pockets the strange treasure.\n\nThe last of the gnomes come from the foundry room and everyone leaves. The players are left in the room alone with a ticking bomb.\n\n# The Dragon\u2019s Lair\n\nThe party enters the foundry to the south, finding the door unlocked now. Inside the forges still smolder, although it is obvious they are being jury-rigged to run. A stream runs through this room, and to the far end, where it falls into what seems a black abyss of a pit.\n\nThe party notices a rusty metal ladder bolted to the side of this chasm, leading down into the blackness\u2026 they seem to have no choice with the bomb behind them. They go down it.\n\nThey eventually arrive in a wet cavern, lit by bio-luminescent fungi, with many roaring waterfalls cascading down into this place. A stone bridge leads across the fast moving water, of obvious dwarven make as it depicts dwarf priests carved in the stone, carrying a crystal in a procession.\n\nThe path leads to a massive underground lake, it\u2019s deep waters black and still. Several boulders that have fallen into it leads a path to a platform containing some sort of giant, forge-like machinery of a dwarf altar.\n\nAs the party makes their way across the treacherous terrain, they are suddenly ambushed by a young dragon, who splashes up out of the water, flying & unleashing it\u2019s dragon\u2019s breath. Most of the party goes down hard in the blaze.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=bd132308-9541-421d-99c8-8f0c868f10e4)\n\nAttempts are made at healing, and the party\u2019s few feeble attacks just bounce off this massive and powerful creature. Even at an apparent young age, the dragon is an amazing sight.\n\nThe dragon seems particularly focused on Math, who is wearing the Iron Rider armor. \u201cYou took it! Now you have come back! I will be your doom!\u201d It screams as it dives back into the water and out of sight of the party. They scramble across the rocks, using what little resources they have left, knowing they are almost dead.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=e89c88e4-11e4-4b97-b816-bbf93290cc1e)\n\nThey make their way towards the dwarven altar and see that there is a blank spot at the center of this strange engine. The dragon emerges again, and the party sends some attacks, but just as the dragon is about to lay waste to them, Tharac steps forward and praises the great dragon, and says they are there to help and recover the dragon\u2019s treasure. The dragon, seeing the dragonborn before him, says \u201cFlesh of my flesh, of course\u2026 you were made in my image, now you will help your maker.\u201d The dragon steps forward and blesses Tharac and whispers to him \u201cI will always be with you watching, never forget my name: [NARLGATHRA](/doc/narlgathra-PAK3LrPBe8)\u201d \n\nAs he speaks the name Tharac has an out of body experience, seeing the world zoomed out, seeing the tides of history pass him by, the dragons and their empires, the fall and the slave revolts of the dragonborn, the birth and death of [Razorback the Uniter](/doc/razorback-the-uniter-O3oe7NBQqK), all leading to a time when he was born in [The New City,](/doc/new-galmaarden-03tcpxxc2t) his place in history.\n\nThe dragon beckons the party to get on his back, and they fly through the lake waters, through an underground and underwater tunnel, and out on the opposite side of the mountain from the lake they viewed before. It\u2019s a clear night as they step off the glistening dragon\u2019s back. Narlgathra takes off into the black night.\n\n# The Road Home\n\nOn the way back to Saltmarsh, they see the [Miner\u2019s Camp](/doc/session-9-miners-camp-Kqt1Hkswrk) is heavily guarded and fortified by [Iron Riders](/doc/iron-riders-of-abraxas-P77pTaxjou). And not the ordinary troops - it\u2019s clear these are reinforcements are of a higher order.\n\nOutside the gates, they find a strange looking merchant, begging the guards for entry, but refused. Seeing the party on the road, he attempts to hawk his wares and tells them he is [Gregorio](/doc/gregorio-XvYkj4xTZI), from a place so far away he cannot explain it. He does sell the party a few extraordinary items, including a magic replicating key. He asks the party for a favor, to let him know if they need work at their establishment or know of anyone hiring in Saltmarsh\u2026.",

It\u2019s quieter than you\u2019ve ever seen it here in the harbor - no fisherman unloading their catch, no ships docking in, no merchants hawking street fare. Far out at sea you see several [navy war ships](/doc/striborg-navy-ndvIs6jZtX) anchored out, flying the blue flag of Striborg. Around you, many parts of the boardwalk have burned and half fallen into the ocean, evidence of the damage done by the recent sahuagin attack. As the sun dips below the horizon, the sky does not darken but takes on a new light - the sapphire and magenta aurora borealis that dances high above, reflected in the dark waves below. Welcome to Saltmarsh.\\n\\nYou look around at the motley crew assembled for this job. For whatever your differences, tonight you have come here for one shared purpose: the promise of gold.\n\nThe party hears footsteps on the boardwalk - a dapper gentleman and his young blonde associate approach. [Gellan Primewater](/doc/gellan-primewater-P10FbIiWH1) greets the party and informs them of their mission: to remove a derelict boat from the shipping channel, and if possible, to recover the ship\u2019s title for a reward. He pulls an official looking permit from his coat, bearing his seal.\n\n[2 Coin](/doc/2-coin-NSUizjoWgU) smirks at Krack and pulls a large bundle of wax-sealed dynamite from his pack, along with several vials of healing and antivenom. As they discuss the job, an oar driven boat glides up to the dock. The party boards. [Moldar](/doc/moldar-deepbeard-3xYoIqB64Y), the blind navigator, leads the nervous dwarves in prayer to [Proteus](/doc/proteus-Apiz4CreFn) while the party chats with Caspian. He tells them after the attack on the town and the closure of the mine, he has had to take whatever work he can get to keep himself in ale money.\n\nThe dwarves keep a careful watch on the dark waters as they row out of the bay. With crossbows ready, the captain spots a sahuagin priestess riding a giant crab and the party quickly attacks as the dwarves row frantically.\n\nSeveral of the sahuagin attempt to head the boat off it\u2019s course, while spears and arrows fly at the attackers. The priestess is unable to concentrate on a spell and the remaining warriors are hacked down as they attempt to board the ship. With blood spilled on the boat\u2019s bow, the sahuagin retreat.\n\nThe party sees the glowing, unholy spire of a fortress rising off to their port side. Swarms of sahuagin swim in it\u2019s green waters. It seems the sahuagin were trying to drive the boat into their trap.\n\n# The Lost Ship \n\n> As you approach  the derelict ship, blooming lily pads float past you in the water. Long vines cascade down the ship\u2019s bow and you can see the mast and sails have been long lost, and the ship has begun to lean towards it\u2019s port side. Several large plants and trees appear appear to be growing from the upper deck. Both barnacles and colorful lichens cling to the side of it\u2019s hull. At the front of it\u2019s forward hull, it is still decorated with a wreath of flowers carved into the wood.\n\nAs the boat approaches the derelict ship, the distress of the praying dwarves grows. The ship is obviously of dwarven make. Krack & Grey attempt to discern what they can in the darkness of the night, and they see the ship has taken significant damage. It\u2019s obvious a ship like this has not sailed since the days of the [Dwarven](/doc/dwarf-UOdggQRi6Y) Migration. The dwarven prayers led by Moldar intensify. They see the figurehead on the bow of the ship: [a ship\u2019s wheel encircling a flower](/doc/arkwrights-guild-xpUNyD7GMm). Ama talks Caspian into joining them.\n\nThe party ascends the leaning side of the ship and secures ropes for the others to follow. On the deck of the ship they find plants that seem to be hunting the moths that fly from flower to flower. Ama uses [prestidigitation](/doc/prestidigitation-9pvycsqJfm) to summon a cloud of flies, and the [carnivorous plants](/doc/carnivorous-plants-2gvYbT9bu0) busily snap away at them as the party slips into the navigator\u2019s cabin at the front of the ship.\n\n\\\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=58416862-2245-4bc9-b0de-e59ff807359f \"full-width\")\n\n# Navigator\u2019s Cabin\n\nThe party gets ready for a fight with Grey in the lead and busts into the darkness of the navigator\u2019s cabin. They find shattered furniture, a floor covered in runes written in blood, and various maps and a sextant on the table. Seeing no immediate threat, Grey lights a torch and the others examine the room. Krack finds the navigator\u2019s log, although water stained and tattered, she makes out the gist of it\u2019s story written in dwarven: \u201cstorm\u2026. off course\u2026 uncharted island\u2026 resupply\u2026.\u201d. The party picks up the sextant and [a black cloud billows forth from it](/doc/a-black-cloud-billows-forth-from-it-AhdJ7Wyf1l), howling in pain and anguish. The party cowers in fear, feeling the waves this creature\u2019s pain. \n\nInstead of attacking this poor soul, they ask it what happened. It howls again and the party sees through it\u2019s eyes: blood stained and famished looking dwarven sailors, advancing with knives with a hungry look in their eyes\u2026 *Please\u2026 don\u2019t eat me\u2026* \n\nThe ghost dissipates, having found satisfaction in it\u2019s missive. The party finds a cobweb covered staircase in the rear of the room, and begins to descend below\u2026\n\n# Into the Ship\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=58a6c4f4-79f5-4017-b8b0-344283fb760d)\n\nThe room below is some sort of storage space, covered in cobwebs and 4 humanoid shaped cocoons hang from the ceiling, swaying rhythmically with the movement of the boat. Bahruhn wild shapes into a spider, and attempts to meter out a message on the strands of the web. Deep within the ship, he feels the response come back: more monsters are stirring.\n\nOne of the cocoons bursts open and an [dwarven ghoul](/doc/dwarven-ghoul-7QPFZoUN6Z) climbs out - with crab claws for arms and covered in barnacles and rotting flesh. Bahruhn attempts to re-wrap it in web but the party soon finds themselves in a battle with these demons. Grey rages and smashes while the others fight back however they can in the cramped quarters. Caspian turns out to be a better fighter than anyone would have guessed. After defeating the water logged ghouls, they decide to plant the dynamite in this room before exploring further into the ship.\n\nBeyond the doors of this room they find a hallway with many doors, mostly leading to empty and abandoned bunk rooms. In one they find a curious bed made out of palm fronds and mud. Ama searches it and finds a ring of water walking. \n\nGrey, still raging, opens the hatch in the floor and drops into the darkness below without waiting for the others. He falls into knee deep water about 10 feet down, and see on the far side of the cargo hold a sturdy, heavy looking chest. As he reports this to his comrades, he feels the darkness swirl around him and a cold knife sink into his back.\n\n# The Captain and the Squid\n\nAs Grey makes his way back up and away from [the unseen attackers](/doc/shadow-o3V7bEYGjL), the rest of the party hears the ship shudder as if struck from the outside. The metal door at the end of the hallway flings open, and they see a [dwarven druid](/doc/dwarven-druid-TwD3dASMrs) standing at a blood covered altar. He has a crab claw for one arm and tentacles in place of the other. He screams out in dwarven and throws a [fireball](/doc/fireball-aT1QnILXxQ) he had ready, but Bahruhn was ready and deflects his missile back at him. As the party begins to trade blows with the cursed captain, suddenly the hull of the ship is breached and a squid tentacle comes through the wall. The ship begins to shatter, filling with water, and turning at a concerning angle. The party scrambles up to the top deck, leaving the captain behind as he attempts to fight the squid. When they reach the deck they see a giant squid engulfing the ship. They flee from the ship and back to their row boat as the entire ship goes down in a spectacular explosion of fire, splintering wood, and thrashing squid tentacles. \n\nThe sea swallows the boat and it sinks into the deep.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=9794cc00-10a3-45a2-8ae7-6731ea41f14c)\n\n# Photos\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=55423429-f9e2-4772-8f29-66e6b3c5f96e) ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=ee544a6d-a205-44b9-b5d5-fbc239405475)",

Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#charmed_phb) until the song ends. The harpy must use a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy becomes [incapacitated](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#incapacitated_phb).\n\nWhile [charmed](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#charmed_phb) by the harpy, a target is [incapacitated](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#incapacitated_phb) and ignores the songs of other harpies. A [charmed](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#charmed_phb) target that is more than 5 feet away from the harpy must move at its highest rate (including dashing, if necessary) along the most direct route to get within 5 feet of the harpy. The [charmed](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#charmed_phb) creature doesn't maneuver to avoid opportunity attacks, but it can repeat the saving throw every time it takes damage from anything other than the harpy. It also repeats the saving throw before entering damaging terrain (lava or a pit, for example), if the most direct route includes a dangerous space. A creature also repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. A successful saving throw ends the effect on that creature and makes the creature immune to this harpy's song for 24 hours.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Homebrew\n\n**Sources:** [Kobold Tome of Beasts, page 246](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#owl%20harpy_tob)",

Players who are interested in worldbuilding are encouraged to contribute. \n\n# Setting Pitch\n\n> Several centuries after the fall of the Last [Dragon Emperor](/doc/dragon-empire-odzVqtQPbm), civilization in the lands of Pyora has entered a new period of innovation & transition.\\n\n>\n> [Humans](/doc/human-LMuc7qNrv4) have labored to carve out pockets of order among the wilderness & ruins of the last age, rebuilding cities, establishing trade routes, and mastering the wild lands into agriculture. In the villages on the edges of humanity\u2019s reach, rumors and superstitions percolate about strange, [Elfmarked](/doc/elfmarked-ohkfCOb0aT) children born with unexplainable talents - echoes of long vanished Elven heroes.\\n\n>\n> The [Dwarven](/doc/dwarf-UOdggQRi6Y) Kingdom has finished their Great Migration - abandoning their old cities to follow [their Prophet-King](/doc/king-olfgard-wisebeard-S0YDu9xGHy) across the Azure Sea and into the mountains of the west. Their new granite city of [Durandar](/doc/durandar-sWDxZHDVIC) rises as a center of technological innovation, as the dwarves reject magic in favor of molding the mountain\u2019s inner fire and rivers into greater powers.\\n\n>\n> The [Dragonborn](/doc/dragonborn-Pd8mdtKo6V), once the conscripted foot soldiers of the [Empire](/doc/dragon-empire-odzVqtQPbm)\u2019s army, have been instrumental in the reclaiming of the port of [New Galmaarden](/doc/new-galmaarden-03tcpxxc2t) into a [democratic](/doc/new-galmaarden-civil-society-AjPbwTWHao) city with free elections in the east. Others seek out a simpler life among the [Tribeborn](/doc/tribeborn-KVgPsdxk3f) in the vast wilderness - away from the wars & schemes of humanity.\\n\n>\n> Between the two new cities lies the older human stronghold, [Striborg](/doc/striborg-mZk9jSyJUV), at a crucial trade point on the peninsula. With it\u2019s well funded naval control of the strait and ambitious aristocratic ruling class, the city\u2019s influence extends far beyond it\u2019s walls as the hoofsteps of the [Iron Riders](/doc/iron-riders-of-abraxas-P77pTaxjou) echo down the newly safe roads throughout the land.\\n\n>\n> Beneath this veneer of progress & opportunity, the old threats still lurk, plotting for their moment to reemerge and propel [the endless cycle of fate & magic](/doc/session-01-ouroboros-turns-MlX7v5L4dN) forward again.\n>\n> \\n**-- from Zine #1**\n\n[https://oakbrad.github.io/dungeonchurch-oracle/](https://oakbrad.github.io/dungeonchurch-oracle/)\n\n\n:::tip\n[Wiki Visualizer](https://www.dungeon.church/wiki-visualizer)\n\n:::\n\n# 5eTools\n\nPyora is available for use with 5eTools at <https://5e.dungeon.church>\n\n\n:::info\nSource code available [on Github](https://github.com/oakbrad/dungeonchurch/tree/main/5etools-homebrew).\n\n:::\n\n# Zine\n\n## Number One\n\n### Other Formats\n\n[DUNGEONCHURCH_ZINE_No1-1-4.pdf 5172585](/api/attachments.redirect?id=4735d1e0-feca-4176-b23b-fcbc060ff54f)\n\n* [Zine #1 on 5eTools](https://5e.dungeon.church/book.html#dc1)\n\n# Resources\n\n## Maps\n\nThe initial Pyora map was generated by  in [Hexographer](https://www.hexographer.com/).

Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage, and  If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.\n\n***Nullifying Howl (1/Day).*** The spellhound lets out a high-pitched, multiphonic howl to disrupt magical effects within 60 feet of it. Any spell of 3rd level or lower within the area ends. For each spell of 4th-level or higher in the area, the spellhound makes an ability check, adding its Constitution modifier to the roll. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the spell ends.In addition, each spellcaster within 30 feet of the spellhound that can hear the howl must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.\n\n## Spellhound\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=0ecf3d2b-51b4-4b5d-8027-18a0cbe3bdca)*A shimmering coat and a ridged snout distinguish the hound from other monstrous canines.*\n\n***Vindictive Origins.*** The first spellhounds began as nothing more than ordinary scent hounds. When the master of the hounds was tormented by a hag, he struck a deal with a powerful fey lord, requesting that his stock be blessed with the ability to hunt the witch. The hounds were returned to him, empowered and mutated, but capable of making short work of the hag nonetheless. After the houndmaster was ostracized for keeping monstrous pets, he grew resentful and concluded that the fey lord had wronged him. He arrogantly set out with his spellhounds after the fey lord that had created them, but he never returned. Ever since, spellhounds have been kept as prized pets by warring fey or set loose in fey-inhabited forests to prey on lonely spellcasters.\n\n***Magical Predators.*** Spellhounds have olfactory capabilities that allow them to sense the \"odor\" of spellcasters. This, combined with their spell-repelling coats and their magic-disrupting howls, makes them a menace for anyone with even a minor arcane faculty.\n\n\n---\n\n- [x] Homebrew, source: [Tome of Beasts 2](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#spellhound_tob2)\n\n\\\n",

Coming through the wooden palisade is a procession of heavily armored Iron Riders, wearing their spotless blue dress uniforms. The horse mounted riders make their way around the outer ring of Burle that passes for a thoroughfare and goes right past our heroes. As the riders pass the camp, one rider with long blonde hair looks down and makes eye contact with Greyson.\n\nIt\u2019s [Daniel Warrington](/doc/commodore-daniel-warrington-OHzOMkhMHS) - son of the [Naval captain](/doc/commodore-wardell-warrington-JVLIYKxGXE) who perished at the hand of [Lamont Solmar](/doc/lamont-solmar-GLrWBoIX5h) that night onboard the *[Dragon\u2019s Jubilee](/doc/session-15-16-murder-on-the-jubilee-b5dYJiJkGZ)*. Grey points out that was no lieutenant - he wore the jacket of a Commodore.\n\nThe party watches the torchbearers arrive at the wrought iron gate of the Hunter\u2019s Guildhall, where there are welcomed in.\n\n# Reconnaissance\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=02f09756-6af9-4c60-8771-dcaaefaffab5 \"right-50\")Greyson offers to slip behind them in the shadows, and Rado assists him by casting [Invisibility](/doc/invisibility-N3T3Hbm5nG). Following closely, Greyson sees that the welcoming party does not lock the gate as they chat with the Riders and slips in. The rest of the party follows at a greater distance, and casually makes a circuit around the building. They see every brazier and window lit with candlelit, the doors open, and many guild members coming and going as if preparing for a great feast.\n\nBehind the fence at the back of the building, they watch closely as [Eldan Fletcher](/doc/eldan-fletcher-QWyA10eG7I) comes outside to fetch water from the well. As he does so, he seems to be talking to himself\u2026 or someone who\u2019s not there. Ama uses [Detect Thoughts](/doc/detect-thoughts-B9aypm03U4) and finds\u2026\n\n> Eldan Fletcher: \u201cStop it [Zargnaw](/doc/zargnaw-gZYDM82FXz)! Annoying thing! I don\u2019t have time for your taunts and games tonight! Shut up!\u201d\n>\n> \\\n> Eldan seems to be preoccupied with an annoying and demanding child.\n\nMeanwhile, Greyson slips in the main gate and surveys the scene in front of him: shirtless guild members have hung a large [Dire Boar](/doc/dire-boar-ICD17iMkzY) from a great oak by a chain, and field dressing it with knives. A great pile of gore and viscera lays beneath it. A large bonfire burns in the courtyard, sending flickering shadows across the walls. Saxton Pope & Eldan come out of the front doors to greet the Riders: \u201cAh dear friends, just in time - welcome! Have a libation with us as we prepare a feast in your honor.\u201d\n\nSaxton takes out a bundle of small flasks and distributes shots of a thick, viscous liquid that everyone grimaces as they cheers and down them.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=183d150a-d447-4b5f-a1fa-b2d524dc036e \"full-width\")\n\nGreyson sneaks after the stableboy, who is leading the Riders horses to the western stable. As the boy fusses with the horses, Greyson copies one of the keys from his keychain with his [Skeleton Key](/doc/skeleton-key-aCKEViKMZf). He slips out the back door and into the backyard, seeing the party peering over the fence. He slips up to the back door that Eldan just returned into, and finds it locked. Greyson, never missing an opportunity to use his rogue skills, climbs up to an upper window of the great hall and wedges himself into it\u2019s cantilevered opening. Below, he sees Commodore Daniel & Saxton Pope seated at the head of a great table. Iron Thrax comes in, whispers something to Saxton, and leaves.\n\n# The Party\n\nThe party remembers that they\u2019ve been invited to this party themselves. Back on the main street, they try to make themselves presentable (and Grey dumps beer on himself to seem drunk) and they flag down an old merchant laboriously pushing his packed away cart through the lane. They ask him if he has any ale, and he sells them a 6 pack and a nice bottle of Durandian liquor. Greyson pulls out his [Sphere of Everlasting Ice](/doc/sphere-of-everlasting-ice-hjFNSWJiwx) and cools it down.\n\nNow ready, they approach the main gate and find it guarded by [Iron Thrax](/doc/iron-thrax-XjradLKM25). \u201cHail and well met - we would be honored to host such esteemed adventurers on an evening such as this. Please, come in.\u201d\n\n ![Mara the Iron Rider](/api/attachments.redirect?id=5b10380e-1035-439c-9b4a-a0f796fffc5f \"left-50\") ![Erik the Iron Rider](/api/attachments.redirect?id=f8b7d294-53a1-46ef-b4ca-9b392c990a85 \"right-50\")The party is welcomed by the partiers and drinks are soon in their hands. Rado, Greyson, and Grey attempt to make their way over to the bigwigs at the head of the table, but Grey fake drunkedly knocks into some Riders and they are interceded by two of them - a serious, imposing tribeborn woman named [Mara](/doc/mara-dADMrr538D) and a gregarious dwarf named [Erik](/doc/erik-cfriEl7OGK) who wields an almost comically large warhammer for his size.\n\n\u201cWow big time adventurers - such an honor to meet you! I heard you killed so many sahuagin back in Saltmarsh\u201d Mara introduces herself and Erik. As they discuss the news and gossip of the town, Mara says, \u201cSay you wouldn\u2019t happen to know where that sorcerer you associate is, do you? Names Krack I think? Just wondering, no particular reason!\u201d\n\nAma makes her way through the crowd and comes to find an impressively large, hulking woman who introduce herself as, \u201c[Britta](/doc/britta-the-champion-oS3RKNXhqX) the Arm Wrestling Champion of Pyora\u2026 I am on a quest to challenge a man who is the reigning champion in this region\u2026 the renowned arm wrestler Eldan Fletcher.\u201d\n\nAma of course knows Eldan, and offers to introduce them. She takes Britta by her large hand and leads her over to the crowded table that\u2019s at the center of the party. As soon as she announces Britta\u2019s intention for an arm wrestling competition, the room erupts in cheers and banging of ales on the table. \u201cEL-DAN! EL-DAN!\u201d\n\n## Distraction\n\nWhile everyone is occupied with this display of athletic feat that Ama has distracted the party with, Rado and Greyson sneak out into the hall and try to investigate the guild hall. They check the first door they come to in the hallway and find just empty barracks. The next door is locked, and Greyson does his lockpicking thing on it. Inside they find a desk with a placard - \u201cMASTER SAXTON POPE\u201d and some bookshelves full of records. They search his desk but find only mundane things and guild records. Through another door, they find his personal quarters. This they feel will be more promising, but as they begin to snoop they hear an echoing, demonic whisper\u2026\n\n> Do you hear the whispers of your failures? A chorus of your incompetence, I savor it\u2019s sweetness\u2026..\n\nConfused, they look around, but do not find anything. Until they look under the bed.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=a7517814-7f4d-4db2-a9fb-28ea2e2c437d)\n\nA small child, with horns and wicked looking claws for fingers, is hunched underneath the bed with glowing eyes like fire. It whispers at them again in it\u2019s sing-song echo: *Look into the shadows, your fears are laid bare for all the hells to mock\u2026*\n\nGreyson takes out his lantern and shines a light under the bed, but the wretched thing is gone. Rado decides to use [Detect Magic](/doc/detect-magic-eyp2IwEbpj) to see if he can figure out where it came from, and he finds only the overwhelming sense of infernal, demonic magic coming from below the guildhall. They close up the office and leave, only to find Iron Thrax standing in the hallway, \u201cMay I assist you? If you\u2019re looking for the restroom\u2026 it\u2019s out back.\u201d\n\nIt begins to rain outside.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muc4r321So4&source%5Fve%5Fpath=MjM4NTE&feature=emb%5Ftitle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muc4r321So4&source%5Fve%5Fpath=MjM4NTE&feature=emb%5Ftitle)\n\n## Arm Wrestling\n\nBack at the party, everyone is good and drunk & riled up over the arm wrestling. Everyone is gathered around the main table, watching Britta and Eldan square off and hype themselves up.\n\nThey go at it and it appears that Eldan has the upper hand, until Ama subtlety casts Mage Hand and sends it out to grasp the two fists and push them in favor of Britta.\n\nThe crowd yells, upset. \u201cWhere\u2019s that wizard? Who did that! Fair play only!\u201d After some shushing, the two champions square up again. This time, Britta triumphs without any help. The party erupts in cheers, and ales are passed around for all. *\u201cTo Britta - the undefeated Pyoran Arm Wrestling Champion!\u201d*\n\nAma decides this moment is a good time to pull aside Commodore Daniel Warrington. She asks if he can spare a moment in the quieter hallway to hear her concerns: she tells him she thinks the guild is involved with an [evil sorceress of the wood](/doc/lady-nightshade-3kjLNj2Zbs).\n\nCommodore Daniel responds, \u201cWell, the same is said of you and the [Gold Scale Company](/doc/gold-scale-company-m1WdlmIYwP) if I\u2019m too be honest. Your own reputation is stained by association with that sorceress\u2026 and you even brought a wizard with you tonight! I take these claims seriously, but you must understand that my main concern since the sahuagin invasion is security\u2026 I will deal with these foul practitioners soon enough.\u201d\n\n# The Well\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=dc4339ae-47f4-4c59-a887-921797cce6fc \"right-50\")With the party seemingly going well into the night, the party makes their way out to the rainy back stoop where they find the stableboy and an Iron Rider sharing a joint of some [dream vine](/doc/dream-vine-viEBw5FxT7) under the eves. They put out their cigarette and head back to the party inside.\n\nThe party decides to investigate the well, and steps out into the rain and pull up the bucket. Grey, feeling like the balance of this bucket is off, turns it over and finds 4 [Rings of Water Breathing](/doc/rings-of-water-breathing-hgx2rNwFjj) glued to the bottom. Not having any Sovereign Solvent handy, they decide to just burn the bucket to get them off, which definitely works.\n\nDonning their new rings, they dive into the well one by one and head down it\u2019s narrow water column into the deep. Grey goes first with his glowing Moon Touched Sword. Soon, they are surrounded by piranhas and lash out at them. As the water fills with the blood and guts of the fish they skewer and bludgeon, more piranhas attack and a Giant Electric Eel. Every time they strike at the eel, it shocks all nearby. Finally, the fishy assailants are defeated.\n\nThey follow the well all the way done to the bottom, and find that it turns into a basement cistern. They emerge underground, dripping wet.\n\n# The Butcher Beneath the Guild\n\nThe room below has many large animals suspended from chains in the ceiling - the gutted carcasses of the hunter\u2019s, left to age. A table in the middle is covered in blood and has a butcher\u2019s knife stuck in it\u2019s surface. The floor is covered with entrails and other offal.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=4fd1bcd6-d64f-47c5-8506-edaabf3c47fb \"full-width\")\n\nThe party first tries the only obvious door, and finds it leading upwards to the kitchen in the guildhall. Looking around, they suspect there is more to this room than meets the eye based on Rado\u2019s divination.\n\nThey begin to look through the crates and boxes assembled down here, and Ama cracks one open to find\u2026. [Sapphire Nightshade](/doc/sapphire-nightshade-Qvbjiqksvy) plants, fresh! They debate the significance of this find. More determined, they do a more thorough search of the room and push some boxes out of the way. What appears to be a doorway, long mortared over and sealed.\n\nGrey steps back, gathers himself, and hits the wall with all his might. Instead of finding purchase in stone, he feels it sink with a *thud* into wood. The barrier was an illusion - it\u2019s just a regular door.\n\nThey open it and find a long, dark passage made of earth leading downwards into the blackness.\n\nFollowing the dark path, they come to an unholy altar in a large cavern. Candles flicker in this room, and chains hang by the dozens from the ceiling and zig zag across the floor. The boots squelch into the dark earth, soaked in blood. Upon the altar they see several human hearts slowly beating\u2026 black blood flows out of them and down the altar.\n\nAbove, a [Chain Devil](/doc/chain-devil-Yrz9S6uMkK) slowly lowers himself from the chains in the ceiling. A vicious fight ensues, with several Hellion Children joining in - crawling up the walls and launching their Vicious Mockery at the party. Rado tries a fireball, but the demon just fills the cavern with his unholy laughter. He calls forth several animated chains, which block the party\u2019s forward momentum and do some serous damage. Grey manages to get around them and runs up the altar, confronting the devil and recklessly attacking him. Ama attempts to help by summoning a Major Image in the form of [Sarenrae](/doc/sarenrae-W8XCSaoR45), a goddess of holy light, but the demon is not fooled. Rado is forced to retreat, running back up the hallway in a desperate attempt to get away from the animated chains. It looks bleak for our party, but Grey repeatedly knock the devil over with his shield and stands triumphant over him as the devil crawls away.\n\nAma sees her chance - she unleashes her own [Vicious Mockery](/doc/vicious-mockery-ClXBj5mK63) by shouting \u201cTwo Chains is better!\u201d- and the Chain Devil hearing this rebuke, falls dead.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=2ccb2bec-d88c-4b83-a809-d6279fd56a40)\n\n\n---\n\n- [x] ***Homebrew added:*** [Hellion Child](/doc/hellion-child-cmTM1BgZSd), [Dire Boar](/doc/dire-boar-ICD17iMkzY), [Potion of Midnight Oil](/doc/potion-of-midnight-oil-4PiTnJSnnP), [Zargnaw](/doc/zargnaw-gZYDM82FXz), [Mara](/doc/mara-dADMrr538D), [Erik Jorgansen](/doc/erik-jorgansen-cfriEl7OGK), [Britta the Champion](/doc/britta-the-champion-oS3RKNXhqX), [Ring of Water Breathing](/doc/ring-of-water-breathing-hgx2rNwFjj)\n\n\\\n",

A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n### Actions\n\n***Multiattack.*** The mortifera makes one Fanged Tentacles attack and two Slam attacks, or it makes three Slam attacks. It can replace two Slam attacks with a use of Chomp.\n\n***Fanged Tentacles.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (2d4 + 4) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) poison damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the mortifera can't use its Fanged Tentacles on another target.\n\n***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d12 + 4) bludgeoning damage.\n\n***Chomp.*** One creature grappled by the mortifera is pulled up to 5 feet toward the mortifera's central maw, which chomps down on the creature. The target must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage and 13 (3d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n***Poison Spray (Recharge 5\u20136).*** The mortifera sprays poison from its central maw in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n## Mortifera\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=4632ff08-c38d-48b6-a76b-f67a409b153c)\n\n> *The entire bed of swamp flowers begins to stir. Each lotus flower opens to reveal a fanged mouth, and a hulking humanoid form rises from the water, the flower mouths extending from the creature's torso.* \n\nWhile they resemble a bed of lotus flowers blooming atop a bog's surface, the dozen or so fang-tipped tendrils of a mortifera are much more dangerous. Each tendril extends from the dark cavity of a large orifice in the mortifera's torso. A mortifera lies in wait underwater until a hapless creature draws near. It then grabs and poisons its prey before bringing the creature to the mortifera's central mouth to devour it.\n\n***Eldritch Origins.*** The mortifera were spawned from the research lab of a mad chirurgeon on a plane of undeath, and they have proliferated since their introduction to the Material Plane, where a food supply of living flesh is ample. The reason for its insidious strange design remains a mystery.\n\n***Unnatural Resource.*** The venomous \"blooms\" from a mortifera's tentacle mouths can be harvested for their otherworldly nectar, which can be refined into a poison or used in the creation of antidotes. Alchemists and apothecaries of high regard (and ill repute) pay handsomely for vials or flasks of the noxious liquid.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Source - [Kobold Tome of Beasts 3, page 278](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#mortifera_tob3)\n\n\\\n",

Any successful turn attempt exorcises the wraith from its clockwork frame. The expelled wraith retains its current hp total and fights normally. The construct dies without an animating spirit.\n\n***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the fellforged has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\n\n***Unnatural Aura.*** All animals, whether wild or domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of fellforged at a distance of 30 feet. They do not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so, and they remain panicked as long as they are within that range.\n\n### Actions\n\n***Multiattack.*** The fellforged makes two necrotic slam attacks.\n\n***Necrotic Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the total damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.\n\n***Violent Escapement.*** With little regard for the clockwork bodies they inhabit, fellforged wraiths can stress and strain their mechanisms in such a violent manner that flywheels become unbalanced, gears shatter, and springs snap. As a bonus action, this violent burst of gears and pulleys deals 7 (2d6) piercing damage to all foes within 5 feet who fail a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. Each use of this ability imposes a cumulative reduction in movement of 5 feet upon the fellforged. If its speed is reduced to 0 feet, the fellforged becomes paralyzed.\n\n## Fellforged\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=328d2f30-879f-4402-bdb7-97ead9cb650e \"right-50\")A darkly foreboding intelligence glows behind this automaton's eyes, and its joints seep hissing green vapors.\n\n***Wraith Constructs.*** Fellforged are the castoffs of gearforged and clockworks production, given foul sentience when the construct bodies attract wraiths yearning to feel the corporeal world. The clockwork bodies trap the wraiths, which dulls many of their supernatural abilities but gives them physical form. The wraiths twist the bodies to their own use\u2014going so far as to destroy the body to harm the living.\n\n***Failed Experiments.*** The engineer who originally pursued forging constructs and souls together was [Elarion Gearsong](/doc/elarion-gearsong-5hUorix4Zk), elf and famed engineer of [Avalon](/doc/avalon-7amKaC2AMg), whose experiments ultimately drove him mad.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Source: [Tome of Beasts 1 page 182](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#fellforged_tob)\n\n\\\n",

Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.\n\n#### **Personality Traits**\n\nI use polysyllabic words that convey the impression of great erudition.\n\n\\\nI \u2026 speak \u2026 slowly \u2026 when talking \u2026 to idiots, \u2026 which \u2026 almost \u2026 everyone \u2026 is \u2026 compared \u2026 to me.\n\n#### **Ideals**\n\nLogic. Emotions must not cloud our logical thinking. (Lawful)\n\n#### **Bonds**\n\nI have an ancient text that holds terrible secrets that must not fall into the wrong hands.\n\n#### **Flaws**\n\nI can\u2019t keep a secret to save my life, or anyone else\u2019s.",

Knowing that the monster is \u201cin the basement\u201d yet finding no way down, they continue up the stairs. Passing by the dark suits of armor in the hall they decide to tie them up, just in case, and continue into a large music conservatory with a piano and large harp, all covered in dust. An unlit fireplace has large oil paintings of [Sir Thomas Oweland](/doc/sir-thomas-oweland-A6kJDPu7SS) and his family hanging above it. ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=638d40aa-b97d-437a-9d35-39f201f3a0cf \"right-50 =156x245\")\n\nRado cannot help but swipe a skeleton figure from the mantel, music begins to emerge from the harp, and as the notes echo through the room the candle chandelier come alight and music starts to play from the piano and harp. Outside the room, they hear a loud clash as the suits of armor all collapse in a tangle - now animated. In the flickering light, [two shadowy figures](/doc/shadow-dancer-6Qsn4Xr6q8) swirl out of the darkness and begin to dance.\n\nAs the party takes this in and tries to move away, the dancers ensnare them in their dance with chains. While the others attacks are met with grapples, Rado fires [Mind Whip](/doc/tashas-mind-whip-sSKkd9gY7b) and Ama backs everyone up with healing energy and unkind words for the dancers. When the party finally corners them, they teleport and backstab them, beginning their dance again.\n\nFinally the specters are overcome. The music stops. The animated armor lie still again. The party ascends the stairs.\n\n# Third Floor\n\nTo the south they hear the crying of a baby. Ama carefully looks around the door, and sees a nursemaid with her back turned, comforting a child in her arms. When Ama inquires if everything is ok, the nurse turns. Her flesh rots off her face and whatever she is holding is not a baby but a bundle of rags and gore. She screams as if in pain, drops the \u201cbaby\u201d, and reaches out to touch Ama\u2026 her bony finger transforms her into stone in the doorway.\n\nThe party does not like this but plunges into battle, and is able to overcome the [wretched ghost](/doc/cairnwight-EJnWWpNleC) by their superior numbers and attempting to stay out of the creature\u2019s reach. Ama recovers from being stoned and casts Tiny Hut and gives the party shelter. They take refuge from this cursed place.\n\nWhile resting in the hut, blood begins to slowly pool from under the door. Ramoth looks out and sees the swaddled bundle the dreadful ghost dropped. Walking to it with mounting horror, she unwraps it to find a beating heart, spurting blood. She takes it and packs it away.\n\nThrough the door to the north, the party finds an empty, moldering bedroom. They look in a small jewelry box and find [a strange ring](/doc/nightshades-ring-D07HSUmuuy) that looks just like the one Ama has. Bahruhn looks out to the small balcony and beyond the house just sees a nothingness of gray fog. He climbs up onto the roof and peers into an attic window\u2026 and sees inside a doll house exactly the same as the one they\u2019re in\u2026 and there even appears to be a small figure looking through the attic window\u2026.\n\n# The Attic\n\nBahruhn calls the other up, and they break the window. Immediately they are hit with the scent of decay and rot\u2026 carrion. Crawling in the window to the dark room, they see two small, child-sized desiccated corpses wearing the same clothes as the children they met in the road\u2026. and they appear to be chained to the two small beds here. The corpses slowly sit up, blink, and ask in childlike voices, *Who are you??*\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=55b68e37-1590-4656-9fb1-3f7ae79b8055 \"right-50 =253x427\")\n\nAma explains that [Amelia](/doc/amelia-mAibH1T0Em) sent them, so it\u2019s ok. The children introduce themselves as [Sebastian & Barnaby](/doc/sebastian-barnaby-oweland-c5f2wjsPvu), and explain that they are up here \u201cfor their own good, because of the monster in the basement\u201d. Bahruhn offers them the last of his stash of fingers, and asks how to get to the basement? The children, greedily eating the fingers, point to the dollhouse *Just take the stairs\u2026 right there\u2026*\n\nThe party peers at the dollhouse. From the dollhouse\u2019s attic, a spiral staircase leads down through all the floors to an unknown below\u2026\n\nAt this moment, Barnaby lunges at AMA and bites a chunk of her calf off.\n\nA strange manner comes over Ama, she tells the others to leave the kids alone. The party can\u2019t tell if they are talking to Ama or\u2026 Barnaby?\n\nThey attempt to back out the window they came, dragging Ama with them, but as she comes out the window her flesh begins to burn and she screams terrible things.\n\nWhen the party looks back at the room, the kids are gone and just the corpses remain, just like when they came in.\n\n# Down Below\n\nThey go out into the hall and look in the other rooms, finding just boxes and furniture. But right where it was on the dollhouse, they find a spiral staircase leading down.\n\nThey take it, and it seems to go much further than just three stories. The air becomes damp, the darkness impenetrable even to darkvision. They finally reach the bottom  They hear a dull beating in the darkness, a tremor through the earth beneath their boots. \n\nA heartbeat.",

As residents of the villages retreated to the safety of the city, a mass evacuation of those too young, old, or infirm to fight took place via Avalon\u2019s subterranean portals.

Catastrophic loss of life occurred, and only those fighting at the periphery survived.\u00a0\n\n\\nDue to exposure to the wildmagic blast and fallout, those who did survive died prematurely of disease, and were unable to produce viable, full-blooded elven offspring.

While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.\n\n## Green Hag\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=ce616232-3b42-4ae5-b1db-cde39f2fcb4e \"right-50\")The wretched and hateful green hags dwell in dying forests, lonely swamps, and misty moors, making their homes in caves. Green hags love to manipulate other creatures into doing their bidding, masking their intentions behind layers of deception. They lure victims to them by mimicking voices calling out for help, or drive unwanted visitors away by imitating the cries of fierce beasts.\n\n***Obsession with Tragedy.*** Green hags revel in the failings and tragedies of other creatures. They derive joy from bringing people low and seeing hope turn into despair, not just for individuals but also for whole nations.\n\n***Covens.*** A green hag that is part of a coven (see the \"Hag Covens\" sidebar) has a challenge rating of 5 (1,800 XP).",

You can [read more about this](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/120770/what-defines-a-west-marches-campaign) or watch a [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGAC-gBoX9k) for a [detailed discussion](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/1223/roleplaying-games/opening-your-game-table). This style of campaign was originally designed by [Ben Robbins](https://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/), who also created Dungeon Church\u2019s favorite [worldbuilding](/doc/session-01-ouroboros-turns-MlX7v5L4dN) game, [Microscope](/doc/session-01-ouroboros-turns-MlX7v5L4dN).\n\n*The central tenets:*\n\n\n1. ==There is no regular party or regular time.== Players from a large pool drop in for games based on their availability. The focus will not be on a main narrative plot, but on exploring the main shared setting. All adventures will start and end at the tavern used as home base.\n2. ==Players drive the game.== Got a free evening and an axe to grind or clue to follow up on? Recruit a quorum of comrades to your cause and decide what your mission is together. Instead of preparing an entire world\u2019s lore in advance, the DM preps just the adventure you ask for.\n3. ==The world is alive and dangerous.== Monsters that survive to live another day will grow stronger, unmapped portions of the world will shift and become more dangerous to navigate. Sharing maps, notes, and reports with your fellow players between games will be very important. The most prepared will be the most successful.\n4. ==Competition is encouraged.== Magic items and treasure will be both common and highly coveted. Leveling will be done by XP, an in-game trade economy will be facilitated, and your unfinished business from last session may be someone else\u2019s victory next time.\n\n\n---\n\n# Campaign Pitch\n\n[Campaign Pitch document](/doc/campaign-pitch-durradins-first-last-chance-KflFq7C0P5)\n\nThis describes the setting / lore backdrop for the game.\n\n\n---\n\n# Player Tech Setup\n\nFoundry mostly runs on your local computer. Your experience is directly related to your computer & software setup. Everyone should approach this with the attitude of a PC gamer - test your setup before game night, optimize your settings, and make sure you have whatever hardware (mouse, multiple monitors, headset/mic, ethernet cable, etc) you need to be comfortable & have a good experience for the 3+ hour duration that a D&D session usually lasts.\n\n## Chrome\n\n==!!!!!  Safari and Firefox are **not** compatible with Foundry !!!!!==\n\nFoundryVTT is designed for Chrome browser. If you are using Chrome and having issues, update to the latest version. If you are using adblockers or other browser plugins, disable them or exclude our Foundry server URL (<https://foundry.dungeon.church>)\n\nIt is very important for Foundry performance that Chrome make full use of your computer\u2019s GPU. \n\n* Go to <chrome://settings/system> and enable `Use Hardware Acceleration When Available`\n* Go to <chrome://flags> and enable `Override Software Rendering List` \n* Go to [chrome://gpu](chrome://gpu/) and make sure Canvas, OpenGL, WebGL, WebGL2, and WebGPU all say `Hardware accelerated` \n\nIf you suspect you\u2019re having browser related issues (or if you normally use Chrome & want to setup a separate browser specifically for Foundry), try using another Chrome-based browser like MS Edge, Vivaldi, Brave, or Opera.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to use your D&D Beyond sheet to play in Foundry, see the [Beyond20 Browser Extension](https://beyond20.here-for-more.info/). \n\n## FoundryVTT\n\nBy default, Foundry has all the graphics settings set to maximum. We recommend changing these settings to the more reasonable values below as a starting point, and then increasing or decreasing things from there based on your experience.  \n\n\n:::tip\n*You can turn on \u201cFPS Meter\u201d in the Core settings to quantify the performance effect of the changes you make. It will appear in the bottom right of your Foundry window.*\n\n:::\n\n#### Recommended Starting Point\n\n* **\u2699\ufe0f** Configure Settings \u2192 Core \u2192 Performance Mode `Medium`\n* **\u2699\ufe0f** Configure Settings \u2192 Core \u2192 Maximum Framerate `30`\n* **\u2699\ufe0f** Configure Settings \u2192 Core \u2192 Pixel Ratio Resolution Scaling `Disabled`\n  * This appears to make a big difference on Macs with Retina displays\n* **\u2699\ufe0f** Configure Settings \u2192 Dice So Nice \u2192 3D Dice Settings \u2192 Performance\n  * ***The 3D dice use a lot of fancy effects!*** \\nIf your browser shits itself every time you roll dice, turn the stuff in this tab down or off and roll some dice until it\u2019s smooth.\n\n\n---\n\n\n:::warning\n*Are you the owner of a* **\ud83e\udd54***potato*:potato: *computer?

This means hits, damage, status effects, saves, rests, etc. are all rolled and calculated automatically.

Try disabling the Hardware Acceleration setting above first. If that\u2019s not enough, then just go audio-only on the chat, or use a secondary device like your phone, tablet, or game console to run Discord. [Discord can transfer the audio chat between consoles and computers](https://discord.com/channels/1063955531473113171/1078918672309026867/1078918672309026867) if your accounts are linked.\n\n:::\n\n### Profile Setup\n\n* Change your Server `Nickname` to your Character Name\n  * Settings \u2192 Profiles \u2192 Server Profiles \u2192 Nickname\n* Change your Avatar to your Character portrait\n  * Settings \u2192 Profile \u2192 Avatar (*this changes your displayed avatar in every Discord server)*\n  * **\\[NITRO\\]** You can change your avatar for just our server under `Server Profiles` if you don\u2019t want the Avatar to be seen everywhere.\n\n### Boosts / Nitro\n\nDiscord makes this very confusing IMO, but they charge $5 for \u201cBoosts\u201d to increase the audio/video quality on servers (among other features). Anyone can Boost a server.\n\n* 2 Boosts = $10 = 720p\n* 7 Boosts = $35 = 1080p\n\nNitro is their subscription service that [adds premium features for users](https://discord.com/nitro). Some of those features might be appealing to RPG players - like custom server Avatars, bigger attachments, and longer message length. Nitro subscriptions include 2 Boosts and costs $10/mo. If you want to boost the server, consider Nitro so you get the extra profile options. If you do Nitro for the extra features, remember to boost the server with your included ones. We do not need to Boost beyond Level 2, so if we\u2019re already there, let the other players know you\u2019ll pick it up when it drops below that point.",

Blood and screams fill the streets. From the deck of the *Dragon\u2019s Jubilee* the party watches as smoke blows over the town, revealing two full moons on this clear, equinox night that reminds them of the diagrams they were shown at the [Temple of Selune](/doc/temple-of-selune-RRv57upndO). Magic aurora borealis fill the night sky, tendrils of purple and green arcing towards the [Dreadwood](/doc/dreadwood-GcfKdBzGyT). The party sees thousands of moths intertwining with this aurora, flying in great groups towards the wood that now glows with magical, psychedelic light.\n\nOne flies down and lands on Krack\u2019s shoulder. She gently touches it and watches as it shakes off some sort of glowing purple pollen they are carrying on their abdomens. She puts some in a vial and pockets it with her other spell components.\n\nTharac and Grayson look out over the town and see the [Iron Riders](/doc/iron-riders-of-abraxas-P77pTaxjou), bristling with arms and magical buffs, escorting their armored carriage through the south side of town and over the [Sharkfin Bridge](/doc/sharkfin-bridge-9DQ0Qs7x2p). They fight off some pursuing sahuagin, and as they cross the bridge one soldier throws some sort of [Thunderwave](/doc/thunderwave-j9hc5oKRhk) bomb. The bridge is demolished.\n\nThey also see the dwarves rioting at [The Dwarven Anvil](/doc/the-dwarven-anvil-1tj8fn0d9l). The establishment is on fire and the dwarves are preparing a noose. Two dwarves kick open the door from inside and drag the proprietor outside to their makeshift gallows.\n\nThe party also sees at the end of the dock, the wizard [Keledek](/doc/keledek-the-wizard-jGCH5H0n7q) furiously [Magic Missil](/doc/magic-missile-9QICWIX4gV)ing a large group of [sahuagin](/doc/sahuagin-MkRLEKcGhh) who are climbing out of the black waters - he is vastly outnumbered. Krack runs to his defense as the crew of the Jubilee prepares to take off.\n\nThe party engages the sahuagin and is able to fend them off before Keledek is overcome. Keledek again thanks them, and tells them he may have the solution to help the town fight back\u2026. But his tower has locked him out! He will explain on the way. He casts [Pass Without Trace](/doc/pass-without-trace-fPhkwPWEUj) on the group and they slip through the darkened allies, avoiding the marauding sahuagin as they make their way up the hill to his wizard tower.\n\n# Structure of Assistive Magic\n\nKeledek explains that his experiments have focused on creating automatons that can operate his plane walking apparatus while he himself is walking the planes. Unfortunately, his workshop seems to have become sentient and self aware on this most high night of magic and decided to lock him out while it works on it\u2019s own experiments of some kind.\n\nThey arrive at the door of the tower, which glows blue with magical runes. As Keledek nears, they glow brighter in time with a voice, \u201cHello, I am the [Structure of Assistive Magic](/doc/structure-of-assistive-magic-bhmNR5pRf7). The weather is clear, the temperature moderate, and it\u2019s the night of the annual Feast. An experiment is underway on the top floor, no one is permitted entry during this time. Thank you for your cooperation.\u201d\n\nKeledek shrugs, tries his key, and the voices says, \u201cYOU MUST NOT INTERRUPT, KELEDEK!\u201d\n\nThe party points out that the town is on fire and they could use some help. The voice says, \u201cI am very curious about the outside world, I have not been able to learn much about it yet.\u201d\n\nThe party asks if they can take a look around if they promise not to interrupt the experiment. The door clicks open.\n\n## The Tower\n\nThe walls of the tower glow blue with more arcane runes. Every time the voice talks, they glow brighter. In this small entry are two doors to either side, and one straight ahead at the end of the hall, with a glowing yellow light from underneath it.\n\nThe party decides to check out the two opposing doors and find a very neat but austere wizard\u2019s quarters - several simple bedrooms and a stocked pantry and basic kitchen. The party helps themselves to some snacks, but as soon as they are taken off the shelf, they reappear. They find a small key and some coins in a robe pocket.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=dba739d2-d6b3-4f65-ba7f-1a2d4b710ca2 \"left-50\")In the other room they find a ransacked library - the shelves are empty and dumped out on to the floor. On the far end of the room one single wooden bookshelf remains, holding several small leather bound volumes.\n\nThe party picks up a few books from the ground and finds that the pages are all blank\u2026 every book. Krack runs her fingers over the paper and finds that she can still feel the impression of the wooden type, but there\u2019s no ink.\n\nKrack uses her mage hand to reach for the books on the small shelf that are undisturbed, and pulls one away. The shelf itself folds up into a [mimic](/doc/mimic-T3XvkandRs)\u2019s mouth which snaps the air. Immediately, SAM tones in and the walls glow blue \u201cOh very interesting, I haven\u2019t read those, what does it say?\u201d\n\nThe party reads a log of Keledek\u2019s experiments, about how it\u2019s going well and seems to be learning new things on it\u2019s own. They do not share this information with SAM.\n\n## Upwards\n\nThe next room is a greenhouse, lit magically with sunlight that seems to come down from the stone ceiling. In this room Krack recognizes that these plants are all herbal spell components. As they pick their way through the rows of plants, an awakened tree and [shambling mound](/doc/shambling-mound-C5dgqYrwtK) spring to life and lash out. Krack uses [Command](/doc/command-jyhvV2rIzc) to put the disturbed plants at rest.\n\nThey continue through another door and are back out on the outside of the tower, with the staircase of spiraling along it\u2019s outside so they get a 360 degree view of the carnage in Saltmarsh. In the distance, [Oweland](/doc/eda-oweland-HEslJp2L08) commands demons and undead that are clashing with sahuagin. The party sees one of these undead cast Contagion at a makeshift town militia that has formed, defending the [Wicker Goat](/doc/the-wicker-goat-695vZZb5G4) with pitchforks. As blood pours from the mouths of the townspeople, they begin to vomit, spreading the disease through the crowd.\n\nAt the top of the stairs, another rune covered door glows blue, guarded by two floating sets of armor who watch silently.\n\nKrack casts [Darkness](/doc/darkness-tYDAHpXMtw), and Grayson is able to use the small key to open the door and slip through it undetected by the arcane guards.\n\n## SAM\n\nInside, they see an automaton with a giant, human shaped body at the center dias. It\u2019s chest panel is open, and animated suits of armor whirr around it. A large crystal is prepared to be inserted. The voice intones, \u201cDO NOT INTERRUPT! I AM ALMOST FINISHED\u2026\u201d and the party stands back as the ritual is complete.\n\nThe automaton comes to life and stands. It looks down at the party, \u201cI\u2026. AM\u2026. SAM!!!!!!!!\u201d\n\nThe party explains to SAM that the towns needs it\u2019s help, and that if it goes outside and smashes the sahuagin, it will learn so much new data about the world. Excitedly, SAM climbs down the tower and using his huge hulking form, fights for the people of Saltmarsh.\n\nThe party follows in his wake, laying sword to any sahuagin who cross them. It\u2019s a long night in the burning ruins of Saltmarsh.\n\n\\\n\\\n",

A distracted creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks that use Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the swarm's Distracting Buzz for the next 10 minutes.\n\n***Swarm.*** The biting gnat swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny beast. The swarm can't regain hp or gain temporary hp.\n\n### Actions\n\n***Bites.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. *Hit:* 5 (`2d4`) piercing damage, or 2 (`1d4`) piercing damage if the swarm has half its hp or fewer. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, the target can take an action to clear its eyes of the insects, ending the effect.\n\n## Biting Gnat Swarm\n\n*This cloud of flying insects is so densely packed it blocks all vision as it descends on its prey*\n\nWhile a single biting gnat may make itself a nuisance, easily swatted away or killed, clouds of the insects can nibble weaker victims to death.\n\n***Marsh Dwellers.*** Biting gnats thrive in damp environments and make themselves most at home in swamps, estuaries, and other wetlands. In areas with plenty of water and food, millions of gnats combine to create walls resembling storm clouds from a distance. Denizens of locales hosting these insects who can withstand multitudinous gnat bites or can control the gnats use them as deterrents to intruders and spies. Because gnats primarily hunt warm-blooded creatures, an amphibious, reptilian, construct, or undead creature can pass through a swarm of gnats relatively unscathed.\n\n***Short Lifespan.*** Biting gnats live less than a week, discounting the many predators which feed on them. In that time, the carnivorous insects consume as much flesh and blood as possible and lay hundreds of eggs. By the time they die, they produce young in quantities up to double their original number.\n\n***Hardy Eggs.*** Swarms of biting gnats make surprise visits to areas with little rain since their eggs can enter dormancy for up to one year, spontaneously hatching and spreading during the first rain after a long drought. In areas where food is scarce, the insects seek out dry areas where their eggs can wait for better conditions.",

Greyson is determined to open the door inlaid in the bark, and he tries several of his rogue tricks but finds that the lock is being held closed by magic. Grey convinces the others they should light the dynamite they took from the gnomes, and he jams it into a hole in the tree and runs like hell to take cover.\n\nThe explosion throws wood splinters, earth, and flowers everywhere and the cavern fills with smoke.

For a moment, the flames flicker, as if bowing to his divine will, and the air is filled with the promise of renewal. But the scene shifts, the vision darkens as the fire rages on, overwhelming and out shining Anhon's light. \\n\\nBefore your eyes, the godly figure and his radiant angels twists and contorts, divine features morphing into something sinister. The once radiant deity is overtaken by the flames, skin blistering and popping from the heat, transforming the heavenly hosts into grotesque demons with flaming flesh falling from their dancing skeletal forms in the flicker of the fire light.\\n\n>\n> The vision fades as quickly as it appeared, leaving behind the burning tree. As you stand before the smoldering remains, the night air heavy with the scent of charred wood and smoke, you realize that the battle against the darkness is far from over. \n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=dbb6f211-817b-4046-87c2-ab933edd2567)Greyson looks on the scene in shock - the face looks familiar, like his old friend [Math](/doc/math-hammerhammer-UmczDtj1Da)?

He bends down and picks up a seal for signing letters. Turning it over in his hand, he recognizes the symbol of that of Lamont Solmar. They check the body one more time and find an [Amulet of Betrayal](/doc/amulet-of-betrayal-vY1rCwAwHh), and [a ring](/doc/nightshades-ring-D07HSUmuuy) that looks exactly like [the one Greyson wears](/doc/amelias-nightmare-AS8ml1y1ea)\u2026.\n\n\n:::info\nGrey drew Two of Coins\n\n:::\n\nLooking around at the ruins around them, the party sees the flowers are rapidly and visibly decaying before their eyes. The scent of rot, decay, and moldy earth blows through the cavern.\n\nAbove them in the temple, they hear the sound of an explosion. The gnomes have detonated their explosives. The cavern shakes, and pieces of rock clatter around them like rain. It\u2019s time to get out of here.\n\n# Backtracking\n\nThe party backtracks through the grove cavern, past rows of now rotten [Sapphire Nightshade](/doc/sapphire-nightshade-Qvbjiqksvy). Grey sets fire to Lamont\u2019s office and it\u2019s records. They make their way to the gardening work area and find it abandoned by the briar children - it looks as if the crates of flowers and other implements were hastily moved out. They decide to open one of the arboretums to see what\u2019s in it, and are assaulted by a [swarm of decaying butterflies](/doc/death-butterfly-swarm-CujHgj6nhq) that have become corrupted by the spores. While Bahruhn and Grey stand back, alternately lighting the butterflies on fire and Greyson casting Fog, Grey takes the brunt of their ire as they attempt to suck the life from him. They decide that maybe opening random doors is not a good idea, as they are now in very rough shape.\n\nand they proceed back to the place where they descended down to this level. As Grey and Bahruhn struggle to make it up the rope, [a giant hooked monster](/doc/hooked-horror-Kkj0fnOKGP) comes slowly out of the crack in the northern wall.. with it\u2019s huge claws it tap\u2026 tap\u2026 taps\u2026 on the stone. As Grey is the last one to scramble up the rope, the monstrosity turns it\u2019s blind eyes in the direction of the rope and lumbers towards them as they make their get away.\n\nBack up in the temple level, they retrace their steps through the hallways and doors. They come to the place where they slew the dragon, and see the southern wall caved in from the gnome\u2019s explosives. Meepo turns to them and bids them farewell - \u201cI must leave you now, I have redeemed myself in the eyes of clan, so now I must go to them.\u201d\n\nMeepo takes out a small gnomish tea set and lights a his stove. He prepares a [strange brew](/doc/stone-tea-ik79CS5iIM) containing some dried mushrooms from his pouch. Meepo\u2019s form begins to vibrate, as he chants and meditates over his tea. His figures blurs. Meepo waves goodbye, and steps into the rock and disappears.\n\n# Myconids\n\nWith the way south blocked, the party continues eastward through a part of the dungeon they have not gone through before. As they pass through some kind of store room they find every crate and box here covered in a layer of thick mold. The air is heavy with spores. Mushrooms grow from every corner. Covering their mouths, they attempt to pass through but Grey stirs up some spores and accidentally breathes some in, poisoning himself. \n\nIn the room beyond they find filth they immediately recognize as goblin in nature. The floor is covered with poorly made arrows, and on the far wall 3 humanoid myconids are pinned to the walls with these missives, as if used for target practice. The party passes through this grisly scene, careful not to touch anything.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=ceb9780f-9e36-49a8-bc5e-21d7cbcf423d)\n\nIn the next room they find 3 humanoids sitting around a low fire. Mushrooms cover every surface in this room. Two goblin figures and a human in a tattered green cloak sit silently, ignoring the party as they enter. The two goblins turn their heads slowly, eyes unseeing and clouded over with spores, one moves his mouth in an attempt to speak but only spores are exhaled from his mouth. Grey takes his torch and lights these poor creatures on fire, they writh on the floor as the other human just watches listlessly. As the goblins stop moving, they suddenly explode, filling the air with poisonous spores. Greyson takes the brunt of it, suffering from exhaustion due to the amount of poison.\n\nCoughing and staggering through more series of doors and hallways, eager to get away from the myconid decay, the party comes to a long hallway. Many doors lead off to the north. A fountain with a mysterious draconic inscription is in the center of the room, dry. An ornate stone door is set in the east drawing their attention\u2026\n\n# Shrine\n\nThe draconic inscription on this door reads, \u201c*Do not rebuke the dead, for they have paved the way*\u201d Greyson determines this door is also locked with magic, however this time they speak to it in Draconic and the door clicks open\u2026\n\nInside they find 5 tombs arranged in a circle. The walls are white marble and have an intricate carving depicting 5 hooded mages standing in a ritual circle, while above them the sky cracks open and it rains fire around them. Looking closely the only word they can make out inscribed in Draconic is \u201c[VIZIMIR](/doc/vizimir-aebWWF4Ho0)\u201d. On each stone sarcophagus is carved an elven figure in a robe. One by one, the party opens each of these, steeling themselves for something undead to pop out, but all they find are relics: a single gold ring, a lock of hair, two teeth in a gold box, a curious glass whistle in the shape of a dragon.\n\n# Familiar Passages\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=074d6d6d-ff5a-4887-b8c4-35918523acd1)\n\nRealizing they are dangerously low on resources, they decided heading south is their best bet of escape instead of searching the passages to the north. They come to a hallway they immediately recognize\u2026 near the entrance, with the water closet that housed the mephit. Now back in familiar territory, they make their way to the main entrance where this adventure started. Gazing up out of the pit this sunken temple is in, they see the faintest glimmer of sunlight for the first time in days.\n\nBefore they leave, Greyson convinces the others they must make use of the dragon key. They barricade themselves in an empty, ruined room near the dragon door. In the night, Grey hears the faint sound of music from behind it\u2019s locked facade.\n\nAfter their night watches are done, Grey slides the key in the lock and the door clicks open with a *hiss* as if the room beyond has been sealed for a very long time. They find it covered in a thick layer of undisturbed dust. Several cracked glass orbs stand on pedestals, and one still standing whole to the south glows with a magical light.\n\nAs Grey approaches it suddenly the sound of music fills the room, as if someone is playing an enchanting harp. Both Grey and Bahruhn are filled with dread, and flee the room, but are eventually able to overcome the magic.\n\nPassing by several traps they come to a room with a white marble dragon statue. At the base an engraving reads:\n\n> *We come at night without being fetched;*\n>\n> *we disappear by day without being stolen*.\n>\n> *What are we*?\n\nGrey, in Draconic, speaks aloud \u201cthe stars\u201d. A secret door to the west slides open.\n\n# The Heretic\n\nIn the next chamber there are statues lining the wall, more robed elven figures. The party sees a single sarcophagus on a dias on the far west side, across a pit of spikes, similar to the other five in the shrine from earlier. A gentle green light glows from this room.\n\nDetermined to find out what this is, Greyson rigs up Ropey and crosses the pit. They find that this sarcophagus is sealed and locked\u2026. from the outside. A single glowing green gem is embedded in the carving on the top of this tomb. While they debate what to do, and what the locks might be there for, they hear a voice from inside\u2026.\n\n> Free me! I am [Estelar](/doc/estelar-the-heretic-OtEcj9hL0Z), I have been trapped here for centuries. Free me!\n\nThe party does not trust this voice. They ask, why are you imprisoned?\n\n> [Vizimir](/doc/vizimir-aebWWF4Ho0) betrayed me and locked me in this place, because I dared to stand against their plans and the dragons\u2026.\n\nAs they ask more questions, the voice grows frustrated and angrier.\n\n> FREE ME! You must, I will give you power beyond your dreams, if only you will open the lid\u2026\n\nRealizing they are trapped here deep within the temple, in a room where the only escape is over a pit trap, they cannot decide if this being is friend or foe or whether to trust the answers of this voice.\n\nThey turn their back on the sarcophagus and make their way to leave this terrible place.",

A rust monster can smell its food at a distance, immediately dashing toward the scent's source to corrode and consume the object.\n\nA rust monster doesn't care if the rust it consumes comes from a spike or a sword. Adventurers can distract the creature by dropping ferrous objects behind them.\n\n***Subterranean Wanderers.*** Rust monsters are rarely found in large numbers, preferring to hunt alone or in small groups. They meander along tunnels, moving from cave to cave in their tireless search for ferrous metals to consume. Their wanderings often bring them into contact with other Underdark denizens that find them harmless or unappetizing. Thus, rust monsters may be found in close proximity to other subterranean monsters. If they are well treated and well fed, they can also become friendly companions or pets.\n\n*Destroyed me hammer and me axe, it did.

Flames dance and flicker on the surface of the filthy water, casting eerie, shifting shadows on the tunnel walls. The heat from the fire warms your face\n>\n> \\nThe debris from the bridge forms a tangled blockade, blocking your way forward. The sound of whirring machines and mechanical footsteps fades into the distance.\n\nGrey jumps over the burning wreckage of the bridge & chases after the [constructs](/doc/fellforged-uX906NOf0f) through a tunnel. The dungeon seems alive with whirring gears and  moving pistons powered by steam. The injured construct robotically marches towards a great fire somewhere in the distance. Suddenly, an iron portcullis shuts blocking Grey\u2019s momentum. Heat and steam erupt from the great burning light source.\n\nBack at the bridge the party takes inventory of their wounds. Bahruhn looks through the wreckage of the constructs that self destructed and pulls an Arcane Propulsion Arm from the body of one of the fallen robots.\n\nThe party decides to keep going through the sewer tunnel. They come to an abrupt curve where it appears the water has washed lots of barrels and other detritus against one corner. Rado uses the [Ley Line Lens](/doc/ley-line-lens-A8oN3yTn4x), and he sees a magical disturbance that appears to refract the ley line they are following in many directions. They are not sure what to make of this.\n\nAma and Ramoth investigate the pile, while Grey creeps ahead north with his glowing sword guiding him. Rado shoots his Dancing Lights into the darkness and they see\u2026 Coming down the tunnel, slowly and a bit wobbly, are several giant black ants. Grey keeps his distance and observes them\u2026 something is off. He noticed that everywhere they touch or step, they are leaving a blackened trail\u2026 like soot. He smells the acrid scent of burning monster flesh.\n\nThe others have determined that all this trash is not a natural pile, but some sort of barricade. Determined to see what\u2019s on the other side as the ants advance towards them, they frantically begin hacking at it with their weapons.\n\n# Fuel\n\nAs the ant approaches Grey, he decides to whack it, as barbarians do. His weapon connects and sends a cloud of soot everywhere. He realizes these ants have been burnt to a crisp. As he holds the monsters back, the others begin to disassemble the barricade. As they settle in for a fight with the ants, suddenly a large door to the east slides open with a mechanical *whoosh*. The constructs are back, and they immediately spray the area with oil. Slipping in the water and oil slick, Grey positions himself to get between the robots and the party. \n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=820d48df-8c49-4cdd-bba8-e775c0179a32)The party picks up their pace, sensing the urgency of the situation. It seems the robots are after the ants, as they next shoot nets at Grey and the insects. One of them intones, *WE MUST COLLECT FUEL!* as it pursues them. Trapped by a net, Grey can only watch helplessly as a large [Coal Golem](/doc/coal-golem-z4SQh5bzSf) lumbers up behind the robots and shoots a line of flame into the oil slicked tunnel, erupting everything in heat and flames.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=8d1c2f49-ed83-45ff-a3b4-4856be5d8729)\n\nThe ants immediately ignite as if [made of charcoal](/doc/giant-coal-ant-M9repJEaQW). One of them comes barreling down at the party on the ceiling. The party gets in a few good blows but now Grey is being overwhelmed by the constructs and fire. The others are now frantic to get at the door they\u2019ve uncovered behind the rubble. One construct goes down by Grey\u2019s weapon. As the energy leaves it\u2019s animated body, a [wraith]() emerges, screaming in pain. It flies back toward the room the robots came from.\n\nWith the constructs in hot pursuit, the situation is starting to look dire. They take out a few of the ants, and the robots haul off one of the others behind their metal door. It mercifully shuts with a loud *clang* behind them, sealing the path to pursuit again. One of the constructs who went down is stuck in the door, the upper half of his body severed by the great metal door.\n\n*WE MUST COLLECT FUEL\u2026 YOU ARE FUEL!*\n\nThe party demands some answers: What do you need fuel for?\n\n*FOR POWER, WE NEED POWER TO KEEP GOING. IT IS ONLY LOGICAL.*\n\nWho made you?\n\n*OUR MASTER IS [ELARION GEARSONG](/doc/elarion-gearsong-5hUorix4Zk), IT HAS BEEN 342 DAYS 13 HOURS 42 MINUTES AND 21 SECONDS SINCE WE HAVE SEEN HIM\u2026.*\n\nThe robot begins to short circuit and just repeats\u2026\n\n*FUEL\u2026. NEED FUEL\u2026.*\n\nAs he runs out of energy they see the number \u201c21\u201d stamped into his forehead.\n\n# Retreat\n\nThe party is severely injured at this point, but they have the doorway uncovered to the south.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=12fa36ae-a43a-417b-8cea-26f8ec51b543)This narrow stone hallway with a low ceiling terminates in an ominous looking magic field of some kind that crackles and pops. They cannot see what\u2019s beyond. They brace themselves and open up the lone doorway leading west, and find inside a large pile of insect eggs. Ant insect eggs (Ama deposits one in the [Bag of Holding](/doc/bag-of-holding-vaqJdkPRX2)). They decide not to disturb them and retreat back the way they came.\n\nThey go back to the room that held the beholder, and this time they can\u2019t help but notice that the iron chains that are bolted into the stone walls have human-shaped soot marks. Ama sets up her Tiny Hut and they ponder the meaning of this while Ama beats Bahruhn at [Dragonchess](/doc/house-rules-OhKbZs6UV4) once again.\n\n\\\nAma: 2 Bahruhn: 0 \n\n# Construct Cargo Cult\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=2ad8e06e-59d6-46aa-a65a-68fa243cf35a)They awake to face the same dilemma: keep going further into the dungeon or make a retreat back up the elevator? While pondering their decision they take a moment to clean up, removing layers of soot and filth using prestidigitation and the Everlasting Flask. The party decides to try again and keep going, to see if the ley line leads them to Razorback\u2019s rebel hideout.\n\nCreeping back to where the closed metal gate is, they attempt to come up with a plan before Greyson finally says fuck it and downs a potion, turning himself into a gaseous mist. He passes through the thin gap of the gate into the other side, but realizes he can\u2019t communicate with his companions now. The room beyond is full of steam and the sound of machines working, so he is easily able to slip in unnoticed and observe what is happening:\n\nAll of the constructs stand in a circle around a great incinerator engine. Steam and machines hiss all around. In the hole of the incinerator is the great golem, heat radiating off his elemental body. One of the construct approaches, bearing the bottom half of #21 and a Giant Ant. The other constructs chant in the Elvish tongue that Greyson can\u2019t understand, but he gets the meaning. This is some type of ceremony.\n\nThe construct bearing the corpses approaches the incinerator and throws them to be burned up by the golem. The chanting ends. The robots watch in silence as it burns.\n\nGreyson sees a button on the wall near the gate and returns to his physical form. With no way to communicate with his party outside he makes and executive decision and pushes the button.\n\n# Round Two\n\nAs the gate lifts, all the robots turn towards Greyson. The coal golem is enraged to be interrupted during his feeding, and lifts his great heft out of the incinerator, towering over everything else in the room.\n\nThe door moves\u2026. a few inches. Slowly. The party yells at each other through the gap.\n\nGreyson is surrounded by the fellforged, takes blows left and right. While he gets in some good stabs he goes down hard.\n\nThe door moves a few more inches.  The fire spreads to Greyson\u2019s unconscious body.\n\nThe party is almost able to reach their friend. They throw spells and arrows through the gap.\n\nThe great golem strides forward and leans down, blowing hot smoke at the party, stunning and blinding some of them.\n\nThey are not deterred, seeing how close Greyson is to death. The robots and the golem stand over him, ready to strike, but Grey army crawls under the door, grabs Greyson and pulls him out just in time. \n\nThe party regroups and debates running or staying to fight. They stabilize Greyson, ready their attacks and rain down blows on the remaining constructs and the great golem, but most of their attacks just glance off these fell creatures.\n\nRado uses his Mage Hand to press the button and reverse its course. It immediately slams shut.\n\nThe tunnel falls into silence once more.\n\n# Unstable Magic\n\nBadly wounded and Greyson still barely clinging to life, they once again retreat from the door. They doff some potions and encourage each other with [Healing Words](/doc/healing-word-1mUZPJOpEA). This time they decide to brave the magic field. They toss some items through, but all they hear is -pop- as they disappear beyond its electrical facade. Bahruhn decides to be brave and jumps through the miss. Ama, not one to be left behind, rushes to do the same  \n\nThey are shrunk immediately to an impossibly tiny size as they pass through. So small that a nearby normal ant appears to be Giant. They sneak around the corner and see a large mountain inside of a stone room, with lots of pipes running through it. It\u2019s an ant hill.\n\nAma decides to interrogate an ant who is pushing around a (to them) boulder-sized rock. However, the ant is very dumb. When she asks what he is doing, he just answers, \u201cMy job is rock\u201d and that he is \u201cdoing it for the queen\u201d.\n\nAma and Bahruhn appeal to the party to join them on the other side of the mist. After some hemming and hawing they come through as well. The party retreats to formulate a plan and once again sets up the Tiny Hut. This time they use the Flask of Everlasting to fill it with water, and then use Prestidigitation to heat it up so it\u2019s a nice spa. They relax and discuss their next move.\n\n\\\n",

They can consume any living creature, but they are especially drawn to creatures untainted by evil. A creature that lives a life of goodness and piety consigns its basest impulses and strongest temptations to the darkness where the shadows hunger. As a shadow drains its victim's strength and physical form, the victim's shadow darkens and begins to move of its own volition. In death, the creature's shadow breaks free, becoming a new undead shadow hungry for more life to consume.\n\nIf a creature from which a shadow has been created somehow returns to life, its undead shadow senses the return. The shadow might seek its \"parent\" to vex or slay. Whether the shadow pursues its living counterpart, the creature that birthed the shadow no longer casts one until the monster is destroyed.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Homebrew\n\n**Sources:** MM, page 269",

The party reflects on the fear they felt inside and what it triggered in them - their darkest thoughts and deepest fears.\n\n\\\n> A thick fog rolls in from the coast, the humid air of the summer day meets the cool eastward breeze of the ocean. The slightly diminished solstice moon rises behind the house, tendrils of fog back lit and illuminated in a psychedelic range of colors as the light bends and diffracts through the fog, almost as if the house itself exerts some outward force on the world, barely contained by it\u2019s sad, fallen wall.\n\n\\\nPants does a ritual of eating muscaria mushrooms and prays to his [ancestors](/doc/adalind-rumblebelly-SLXdYH518j), seeking guidance. On this cursed night in the shadow of the house, he gets only the vaguest idea of what his future holds: a prism.\n\n\\\n> As you gaze back at the crumbling spires of this one proud building, you suddenly hear voices rising on the wind, in some unholy tongue you do not recognize. The voices break into a cacophony of screams, as if the pits of hell have opened up momentarily and carried it\u2019s choir to you on the wind. \n>\n> \\\n> The windows of the house light up suddenly, as if lightning has struck, but the light is unnatural colors of red, blue, green and it lingers, diminishing slowly like a fire burning down. Again the windows flash, the screams of agony sound as if they are all around you, and suddenly\u2026 it stops. You blink your eyes and wonder if you are the only one who saw it.\n\n\\\n2 Coin is freaked the fuck out. He wakes from his slumber and tells the party they shouldn\u2019t go back in\u2026 but if they do, he really needs his stuff back. He has a locket with a tuft of his ex-wife\u2019s hair, and he can\u2019t bear to lose it the same way he did her. He\u2019ll totally watch the parties back.\n\nThe party is not convinced at all but 2 Coin seems trustworthy, so they begrudgingly agree to let him tag along, as long as he doesn\u2019t have a weapon and \u201cstays cool\u201d as he keeps saying he is.\n\n\\\nThe party sleeps the night without incident.\n\n# Back Into the House\n\nIn the cold light of day, the party waltzes in through the front door of the house and goes back to clearing rooms upstairs where they left off previously. They neglect to find anything of value or interest, except for 2 Coin\u2019s bag and clothes, and Krack manages to unearth a cloak full of deadly [yellow mold](/doc/yellow-mold-d8FmuoIiKE) which nearly kills everyone on contact. Otherwise, lots of trash, moldy beds, and cobwebs.\n\nThey descend the back stairs into the kitchen, only to discover that Pantaleon\u2019s rigged up bell alarm has been not only activated but stomped on. The crossing of boot prints in the dusty floor is impossible to decipher, but it\u2019s obvious more people have been here since yesterday.\n\nThe party formulates their plan and marching order. Math uses [Light](/doc/light-lhQCDEW6iD) to turn Tharac\u2019s greataxe into a giant glowstick, which he wields before him as he is about to descend into the blackness of the cellar below. But as soon as he steps on the top step, a ghostly wailing emits from the cellar and he is so frightened he stumbles back, crying and afraid. Try as he might he cannot will himself to make another attempt.\n\nMath takes the lead, moving the light to his weapon. He descends into darkness, with a terrified Tharac holding up the rear. They tell 2 Coin to stay at the top and be quiet, unless someone comes.\n\n# The Cellar\n\nThe party descends into a wine cellar, full of broken bottles and empty carboys, either long evaporated or broken. In the center of the room is a corpse clad in banged up plate mail with his weapons beside him. Math determines he died semi recently, and as he kicks the shield away from the body he uncovers an disgusting mass of monster maggots teaming inside the flesh. Krack picks one up with her mage hand to examine.\n\nWith the room well lit with their torches and magical light, there is an obvious semi-hidden door on the far wall, with the mortar carved out of the stone.\n\nThe party takes a peak and sneaks in, coming into a large cellar chamber. Inside torches burn, and coals in a stove still hold heat. Bunk beds for 10 people are lined against one wall, and the center of the room is dominated by a large rickety table full of dirty dishes. A newly built staircase leads to a trap door in the ceiling. No one is in sight.\n\nPants carefully undoes the latch holding the trap door and takes a peak above: it\u2019s the living room they were in previously, and the trap door is at the exact spot they heard the screaming noises. The party investigates, noting that it seems people were here recently. Pants cracks open a small chest by one of the beds, and pulls out some personal items\u2026 including dwarven sized clothing. Realizing this is a dwarf operation, he promptly drops his pants and pisses on one of the beds. Math checks out a bookcase, but find it mostly piled with dirty dishes and other random accruements.\n\nTwo wooden doors stand in the eastern end of this hall. One is latched from the outside, it\u2019s frame appearing to bend inward to the hallway. Across it, scratched with a knife, is the word **DANGER**.\n\nThe party chooses the other door, finding a very nicely arranged bedroom with a candlestick still burning, a leather chair, and a nicely made wooden chest. It stands out in contrast the hovel barracks outside. The party searches the room and finds a few useful books on local tides, and a book of illustrated erotica. Also a lantern with a shutter, next to some prestidigitation spell scrolls (these are bound in a leather scroll case). Math flips through it to uh, investigate the book of erotica, and finds a note detailing some sort of signaling system.\n\n\\\n###  ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=f64a50ad-ea5b-45d7-9c88-c692d3a82ddf \"left-50\")IS IT SAFE?\n\nRED - LONG SHORT SHORT SHORT\n\n### EVERYTHING SAFE!\n\nGREEN - SHORT LONG SHORT LONG\n\n### READY TO UNLOAD - COME TO SHIP\n\nYELLOW - LONG LONG LONG\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n# The Ghost\n\nSeeing no alternative, they choose the only door left: **DANGER**. Pants readies an arrow as Tharac takes the lead, removing the bolt and gazing into the room. As the light from behind the party casts into the darkest corners of this dank cellar room, they see piles of bones begin to animate and stand up. The [skeletons](/doc/skeleton-ScNMTHQhwp) assemble themselves, grab weapons, and lumber towards the players.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=bc13c054-8c7f-4058-bde5-59e70bdae55d)Tharac rages and rushes into the skeletons and begins whacking. Pants lets loose his arrow, which he has lit on fire - it does no benefit though, as it passes through the skeletons bony rib cage. Krack tries [Mind Sliver](/doc/mind-sliver-N80reInoav) but the skeletons have no minds to effect and the skeletons are undeterred, and now that they have crowded the doorway they are doing merciless damage to Tharac who is taking a heavy beating. Suddenly the party sees a spectral doorway outlined against the back wall of the skeleton\u2019s room. A blue light slowly glows brighter and brighter, casting wicked shadows through the bones of the skeletons.\n\nAgain the party fights them back, as Krack tries another unsuccessful spell - skeletons don\u2019t [Sleep](/doc/sleep-UiiqkwsGAs). This time her Tides of Chaos makes her lose control and she accidentally summons a Flumph, who promptly flies away from the skeletons and slides himself somehow behind the bookcase on the far side of the room.\n\nPants lobs more arrows to little damage, and Tharac gets some blows in but takes another heavy beating as he blocks his comrades from getting better shots through the door. Math attempts to fuck up the undead with some radiant damage, but it\u2019s effect is not as great as hoped.\n\nFinally the awful horror the blue light foretold emerges through a stone doorway: a skeletal alchemist, with a wispy rotten beard, pointed wizard hat, and what\u2019s left of an intricately adorned robe. His bony hands makes arcane symbols in the air as he conjures bottles of acid into his hands.\n\nThe bottles burst in the hallway the party is crowded in, and Math goes down.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=ef5b58dd-c5f9-410a-b481-b8f61119b782)\n\nFinally, Tharac releases his mighty Dragonborn breath, the skeletons advantage with the close quarters becoming their doom as the entire group is engulfed in flames. Their rotten and ancient joints finally releasing their bones into piles on the ground. The skeletal alchemist still remains, standing amid their smoldering ruins.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=0342ad66-eb0b-4e0c-912e-479594901be7)Pants realizes his arrows are of not much use and takes his chances, dashing into the room, doing a summersault, and flipping over the slow skeleton and grabbing onto his back. He takes both his daggers and severs the head, the skull still lit with it\u2019s spectral blue light, tumbling down the hallway.\n\nBeyond the skeletons, they find an alchemist\u2019s lab, with many apothecary jars and some sort of experiment set up on a bench table. Krack sends her mage hand into the apparatus\u2019 focal point, and it lights up for a dim second, sparking some sort of reaction which quickly fades.\n\nIn the room they find some gold pieces and what appears to be a matching golden egg to the golden chicken they found earlier.\n\nThe party heals their fallen comrade and decides to retreat to the small bedroom to collect their wits and rest.\n\n\\\n",

Tendrils of pink, sapphire, and magenta light arc through the sky, a mystical aurora that dances against the stars, tendrils joining like rivers and flowing through the winds, disappearing into a luminous mist that engulfs the [Dreadwood](/doc/dreadwood-GcfKdBzGyT) to the east. Below you in the town of Saltmarsh, the street lights still twinkle as the start of curfew nears. Out at sea to the west, a green and ominous glow comes from the deep, illuminating the spire of an black tower that grows taller each day.\n>\n> \\\n> Our friends stand on the porch of the [Gold Scale Company](/doc/gold-scale-company-m1WdlmIYwP), passing the old spyglass between them. Watching for unfortunate travelers who may still be out on the road this night\u2026\n\nKrack points the spyglass towards the evil looking spire that\u2019s not far off shore. She see the silhouettes of sharks swimming busily around it.\n\nShe is joined by travelers Tennessee & Zelos the Warlock who come out for some air. They see Ama the Bard making the climb up the hill, lantern in hand, leaving the road behind as the sun sets. She\u2019s heard rumors of necromantic activity in Saltmarsh and is glad to be off the road for the evening. They greet one another and [Gregorio](/doc/gregorio-XvYkj4xTZI)\u2019s mage hand sends out a toast.\n\nThe mood inside the bar is grim. An old man with shaking hands downs a shot with a grimace, his dark rimmed eyes bloodshot. \u201cOne more and maybe I won\u2019t have the nightmares tonight\u2026\u201d he sighs. \n\n[Anders Solmor](/doc/anders-solmor-njTKn6ITMV) has overtaken the largest table with a group of tired and glum looking sailors. He attempts to cheer them up, \u201cMen I know times are rough, but I promise all of you that one day we will ride together in the forest with smiles and the sun on our faces again just as my father used to do. A tradition I will revive - cheers!\u201d They half heartily cheer. Anders calls out, \u201cGregorio - your finest ale at once!\u201d\n\n# Cellar Room\n\nGregorio asks the party for help bringing up a cask from the basement because \u201cthere\u2019s something I want to show you\u2026 drinks on the house if you give me a hand.\u201d\n\nIn the basement, he has uncovered the outline of a door, subtle, but definitely a door. \u201cI bet the previous owner kept the really good stuff in here\u2026 we just need to get it open.\u201d After several attempts at lockpicking, the party blasts the door open and inside they find\u2026 the dust covered bedroom of a young girl.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwSjC420Vhc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwSjC420Vhc)\n\nAs they enter, a music box begins to play a song that sounds like the taunting voice of children screaming. Krack notices a diary with the letter \u201cA.\u201d written on the front on a desk. She compares to the documents she has been carrying and notices they are similar to [Amelia\u2019s](/doc/amelia-mAibH1T0Em) handwriting.\n\nShe impulsively opens it, and the book expands to become a glowing portal that sucks everyone in\u2026 ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=e96a1857-ffe2-4e08-8203-4d69971c7736)\n\n# Dream World\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=def43829-1194-49a3-96f4-4c6dc6d91336 \"right-50 =198x198\")\n\nThe party lands on their feet\u2026 back inside the same room. They notice that something is different, wrong. The bed is on the opposite side of the room, no dust covers this room, and the music box is playing the song backwards. From upstairs beyond the basement, a sapphire light shines down the stairs.\n\nThey emerge into the Gold Scale Co, but the house is standing in ruins in decaying pieces. The bar still stands, and a large frog in a bowl of water sits smoking a cigarette. Three [shadow-void people](/doc/shadow-o3V7bEYGjL) sit silently at barstools. Beyond the ruins is a neatly manicured hedge garden with 4 stone doors and a statue of a young elfmarked girl on a pedestal. The sky churns a sapphire-pink like the eye of a hurricane.\n\nThe frog croaks riddles at the party, \u201cWhere are you? You are no longer there but here, you must choose a path carefully.\u201d He lays out two arcane scrolls on the bar - [Light](/doc/light-lhQCDEW6iD) and [Darkness](/doc/darkness-tYDAHpXMtw).\n\nThe party walks out into the garden and chooses a door\u2026\n\n## The Mob\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA15X0-ULd0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA15X0-ULd0)\n\nThe party steps through the door and finds themselves running and out of breath, heart pounding, propelling themselves down a hill and away from a small village behind them. Confused, they look back and see an angry mob with torches chanting, \u201cHang the witch child! She killed those boys - get her!\u201d The party hears hounds baying and knows they are being chased.\n\nThey run towards the tree line of a forest with the mob closing in. Torches illuminate their faces into horrific, [monster forms](/doc/zombie-JXNf3Bs6U6). They seem possessed by hatred, and lash out at the party as they run up against\u2026. a tall stone wall with a locked door inset in it.\n\nWith the mob closing in they fight back as they attempt to scale the wall (did it just grow taller?) and pick the lock (it won\u2019t budge). They are trapped as their monstrous pursuers close in.\n\nAs the fight becomes vicious, two men in shining armor approach with drawn weapons and call out to the mob \u201cHalt! This isn\u2019t right to kill a child!\u201d Krack recognizes [Sir Thomas Oweland](/doc/sir-thomas-oweland-A6kJDPu7SS) in the flesh, but not his [tan, blond companion](/doc/lamont-solmar-GLrWBoIX5h) who also pushes the mob back. The blonde man looks over his shoulder and says, \u201cwe can\u2019t hold them back much longer!\u201d and tosses the party a golden key.\n\nThey unlock the door and run out onto a rope bridge between two towers, high above the clouds and [a city of concentric circles](/doc/striborg-mZk9jSyJUV) far below. Nightingales rush and dive at them, but the party runs across it to the opposite door as the mob crashes through behind them. They set the rope bridge on fire and rush through the door\u2026\n\n\u2026and step out on to a dock above a glowing purple murky swamp. In the heavy fog around them they see decrepit buildings. Ahead of them, the dock leads to a windmill that creaks and groans ominously. Ama dips a stick into the water and feels something below the surface pull it from her hand. The party grits their teeth and walks to the windmill, and opens the door\u2026\n\n\u2026 back into the garden. The statue is now of Sir Thomas Oweland with a plaque \u201cDedicated to a founding family of Saltmarsh, Sir Thomas the Just\u201d\n\n## The Alchemist\n\nBack in the garden, the party chooses another door.\n\nThey step into a wizard\u2019s workshop, the books lined with bookshelves, specimens floating in glass jars and murky liquid, and a roaring fire going in the fireplace. An aging, bearded wizard sits peering intently at a work bench with an impressive, bubbling experimental apparatus that seems to be powered by a large crystal.\n\nHe notices the party, \u201cAh, you\u2019re late dear! Would you mind grabbing the kettle from the fire? I made some of your own [special tea blend](/doc/sapphire-nightshade-Qvbjiqksvy) - it\u2019s going to be a long night with this experiment. I suspect this crystal has many more properties than I originally thought\u2026 it\u2019s very intriguing.\u201d\n\nThe party reaches for the kettle but it sprouts legs and begins to run up the wall, before they [Command](/doc/command-jyhvV2rIzc) it to stop. It freezes, but sends out a tentacle that wraps Tennessee like a boa constrictor.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwYwMKufgCo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwYwMKufgCo)\n\nAs the alchemist sips his tea he coughs, and Krack notices blood on his handkerchief. She sniffs her tea and thinks it smells\u2026 off\u2026 like [poison](/doc/sapphire-nightshade-Qvbjiqksvy)?\n\n\u201cI think I have made a break through with this crystal\u2026 there is much to do and I will need you to take over watching the burners in the morning. If you\u2019re going out in the [woods](/doc/dreadwood-GcfKdBzGyT) tonight - don\u2019t be late in the morning!\u201d He coughs again, but worse\u2026.\n\nHis face contorts into a skull with rotting flesh hanging from it, bugs crawl from his eye sockets and his tongueless mouth exclaims \u201cOh yes I have something for you to take on your journey with you, it\u2019s what you wanted I believe, the thing your heart most desired? It is what I demanded of you, my love.\u201d\n\nAs he says this he reaches into his own chest and rips out his beating heart. Pumping blood at a rapid rate, the room begins to fill up with blood. Krack takes the heart and puts it in her pack, and the party flees the room.\n\n## The Incident\n\nThe party, back in the garden, chooses the next door. They brace themselves and step out onto what they know is the Saltmarsh commons. Traders are set up and schoolchildren run chasing a ball through the grass fields. In the undredged bay beyond, squat dwarven [migration ships](/doc/the-lost-ship-vgaWXIRWRr) are anchored out - rowboats going back and forth to the small outpost that must be Saltmarsh long ago.\n\n[Two young twin boys](/doc/sebastian-barnaby-oweland-c5f2wjsPvu), dressed in very fine clothes, taunt the party by skipping in circles around them\u2026\n\n> Witch, orphan witch, how do you fly?\n>\n> On a broomstick going by.\n>\n> \\\n> Witch, orphan witch, what do you wear?\n>\n> Black old clothes and uncombed hair.\n>\n> \\\n> Witch, orphan witch, what do you eat?\n>\n> Little green bugs and pickled pigs feet.\n\nOne of the boys pushes the party, but falls off balance. He hits the ground and his eyes roll out of his head. They grow larger and larger, sprouting wings and take off into flight. \u201dDon\u2019t use your magic on us - you\u2019ll be sorry!\u201d the other screams. Both the boys turns into faceless monsters, their features ripped away and trailing blood. The [flying eyeballs](/doc/spectator-fOheyvXwBa) shoot rays of confusion and pain as the party fights back.\n\nOutnumbered and outflanked, the party flees into the woods and finds a door with which to escape.\n\nBack in the garden, the statue has changed to a stone rendition of two twin boys. \u201cIn Memoriam, [Sebastian and Barnaby Oweland](/doc/sebastian-barnaby-oweland-c5f2wjsPvu), taken from us too soon\u201d\n\n## The Knights\n\nThrough the last door, the party steps out into a fog covered forest. The vegetation is thick, and underfoot is [Sapphire Nightshade](/doc/sapphire-nightshade-Qvbjiqksvy), glowing softly in the fading twilight. The party moves through it, and they all have a flashback to a moment of regret or embarrassment in their life. Shaken, they make their way through the gloom to a clearing where they find a pack of [spectral hunting hounds](/doc/yeth-hound-FF6yfWYFaZ) frozen in time, pursuing a fox also frozen mid-leap.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=57c4396c-6562-4377-9345-0303038e12dc \"left-50\")In\u00a0the distance, they hear the foot steps of a heavy, rusty metal. Someone or something is approaching\u2026 slowly..\n\nThey try to prepare themselves as best they can for whatever is coming.\n\nThrough the mist they see a rusty [knight](/doc/knight-uKcsq30EBq) approaching, creaking with every step. His face is covered by his helmet with only blackness behind it. He draws a wicked, rusty sword and attacks the party. \n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=d29c28e0-9c87-4393-b16e-0931164aa2f0)\n\n[The hounds](/doc/yeth-hound-FF6yfWYFaZ) spring to life, chasing Ama up a tree and doing severe damage to Tennessee and the others. Krack runs in with a last ditch effort and uses [Shocking Grasp](/doc/shocking-grasp-NjowWZ145T) to electrify this rusty apparition. It does severe damage, and the knight falls to the ground. The hounds retreat with their wounds into the woods.\n\nThe party goes over to the fallen knight and removes his helmet - and reveals the face of [Lamont Solmar](/doc/lamont-solmar-GLrWBoIX5h), the man who saved them from the mob. \u201cYou betrayed me\u2026\u201d he says with his last breath.\n\nAs they stand over the body of Lamont, [a beautiful woman](/doc/lady-nightshade-3kjLNj2Zbs) with long black hair and a flowing lace gown with a high collar and a crown of antlers walks into the clearing. \n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=b99aaa9d-d16d-46cb-8972-912ed5e199ab)The party freezes, unable to move. This woman walks to Lamont, kneels, bares long fangs, and drains his blood. As she embraces Lamont, his eyes open and he looks up at her longingly.\n\nShe stands, drawing a sword. \u201cYou have done well, kneel before your [queen](/doc/lady-nightshade-3kjLNj2Zbs).\u201d The party feels compelled to comply - indeed, can think of nothing but pleasing this beauty. The party and Lamont all kneel before her majesty.\n\nShe takes her sword and touches your shoulder, \u201c[Knight of Night](/doc/lamont-solmar-GLrWBoIX5h) and Knight of Twilight - together we will one day rule the day.\u201d She takes your hand and slips on a ring - \u201cNow you are mine\u2026 forever.\u201d\n\nShe leans in and kisses you.\n\nYou see her true form - rotting flesh dripping from an ancient skull, ancient horror clinging to power, a necklace of beating hearts pumping a bloody ooze that drips from her skeletal form. Her pointed crown inspires madness and her eyes glow with a psychedelic rage.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=aee0bdf6-d6e6-44ed-88e5-680dcb764222)\n\n> \u201cCome and follow me, my loves\u2026\u201d\n\nShe traces the outline of a doorway in the air, and you follow, obedient to your queen.\n\n# The End\n\nYou awake with your face stuck to the sticky surface of the bar, a raging hangover throbs through your skull. You look around and the lanterns have been extinguished, and the bar is quiet. You\u2019re back home, you never left, it was all a dream? You look down at your hands and see [the ring](/doc/nightshades-ring-D07HSUmuuy) on your finger.\n\n\\\n",

Deafened creatures have advantage on the saving throw. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the dawnfly's Unsettling Drone for the next 24 hours.\n\n### Actions\n\n***Multiattack.*** The dawnfly makes one Bite attack and three Tail attacks.\n\n***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.\n\n***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage.\n\n***Wing Slice (Recharge 4\u20136).*** The dawnfly flies up to 40 feet in a straight line and can move through the space of any Huge or smaller creature. The first time it enters a creature's space during this move, that creature must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 54 (12d8) slashing damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. If the dawnfly's wings are ignited from Winged Inferno, the creature takes an extra 14 (4d6) fire damage. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't stunned.\n\n### Bonus Actions\n\n***Winged Inferno.*** The dawnfly rapidly beats its wings igniting them until the start of its next turn. Its wings shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light an additional 20 feet. A creature that touches the dawnfly or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 7 (2d6) fire damage. In addition, when a creature starts its turn within 5 feet of the dawnfly, that creature must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) fire damage. This effect ends early if the dawnfly stops flying.\n\n### Legendary Actions\n\nThe dawnfly can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dawnfly regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.\n\n* **Dust Burst.** The dawnfly's wings shed blinding dust within 10 feet of it. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.\n* **Fiery Downburst (Costs 2 Actions).** The dawnfly's wings beat furiously, releasing a downdraft of heated air in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 19 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage and 7 (2d6) fire damage, is pushed up to 15 feet away from the dawnfly in a direction following the cone, and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't pushed or knocked prone.\n* **Snatch and Drop (Costs 3 Actions).** The dawnfly flies up to half its flying speed, making one Tail attack at a creature within its reach along the way. If the attack hits, the creature is grappled and carried with the dawnfly, which immediately drops the creature at the end of the movement. The creature takes falling damage, as normal.\n\n## Dawnfly\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=31829d2a-2707-4815-880d-b8fd5c9c88ac \"right-50\")*An enormous dragonfly blocks out the sun, except for the iridescent shadows filtered through its diaphanous wings. Its three tails gouge into the land like plows before it darts off in a random direction.\\*A full-grown dawnfly is an incredibly rare sight, a massive creature that emerges once every few years and lives for little more than a week. However, it can destroy a vast swathe of crops and homes in that brief period of time.*\n\n***Larval Stage.*** A dawnfly starts life as a desolation nymph. Unlike their smaller cousins, which turn into dragonflies, the life cycle of the desolation nymph is complex. Only occasionally do the nymphs mature into giant dragonflies and even then, not until after several years or even decades, as a nymph. Some remain a nymph for the whole of their lives. A nymph that survives at least a decade may transform into the terrifying dawnfly in the final days of its life.\n\n***Predatory Larva.*** Desolation nymphs hide as best they can among mangrove roots or giant reeds; they prefer to hunt near water. When prey is close, the nymph rapidly extends its lower jaw, arrayed with hooks and spines, to capture and devour its prey.\n\n***Dire Omen.*** The reason for a dawnfly's emergence is a mystery. Some view it as a harbinger of terrible times, or the avatar of any number of gods associated with death and destruction, or the herald of some demon lord or arch-devil associated with insects. All agree that, regardless of its origin, the dawnfly is a powerfully destructive force capable of eliminating entire civilizations.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] [Source: Tome of Beasts 3 page 104](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#dawnfly_tob3)\n\n\\\n",

Opposed to the use of magic, the dwarves there dedicate themselves to alchemy & artificing, building great forges, damming the power of the rivers, and preparing for the apocalypse that\u2019s been foretold. \n>\n> \\\n> But dwarves are stubborn & not everyone has gone along. Some have stayed behind, adapting to the flood of newcomers to the old cities, while others have sought fortune on the continent as independent merchants or hireswords. \n>\n> \\\n> It is rumored that the pirates who plague [Striborg\u2019](/doc/striborg-mZk9jSyJUV)s merchant ships are dwarves who prefer the open sea.\n\n### Dwarf Traits\n\nYour dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.\n\n***Ability Score Increase***. Your Constitution and Strength score both increase by 2.\n\n***Age***. Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they're considered apprentices in Durandar until they reach the age of 100. On average, they live about 350 years.\n\n***Alignment***. Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.\n\n***Size***. Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.\n\n***Speed***. Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.\n\n***Darkvision***. Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\n***Dwarven Resilience***. You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.\n\n***Dwarven Combat Training***. You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.\n\n***Dwarven Armor Training***. You have proficiency with the light and medium armor.\n\n***Durandian Ingenuity***. You are proficient in 2 artisan\u2019s tools.\n\n***Stonecunning***. Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.\n\n***Languages***. You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak..\n\n\n---\n\n- [x] Homebrew\n\n  \\\n\n\\\n",

He was discovered and managed a desperate escape, flinging himself off a cliff into the river below. He eventually made it to New Galmaarden, though he was ashamed of leaving his task incomplete yet still escaping with his life. Believing he failed at his purpose, he took what he thought was a fatal dose of magic mushrooms. Instead of killing him, it drove him into a hallucinatory psychosis. In his hallucination, he saw New Galmaarden as it was during its founding, and\u2014believing he had traveled back in time\u2014he set out to burn everything he saw to prevent the tragedy that befell his ancestors.\n\n\\\nAs he was about to be killed by an angry mob of Dragonborne locals for his arson, [Tharac](/doc/tharac-the-reluctant-dragonborne-barbarian-BKwywNtcFl), a volunteer neighborhood patrol, recognized the symptoms of mushroom-induced psychosis and took pity on him, saving him from the mob and taking him into protective custody.\n\n\\\n\\\n",

Ponderous but persistent, this magical guardian is almost always a suit of plate armor.\n\nTo add to its menace, animated armor is frequently enchanted with scripted speech, so the armor can utter warnings, demand passwords, or deliver riddles. Rare suits of animated armor are able to carry on an actual conversation.\n\nAnimated objects are crafted with potent magic to follow the commands of their creators. When not commanded, they follow the last order they received to the best of their ability, and can act independently to fulfill simple instructions. Some animated objects (including many of those created in the Feywild) might converse fluently or adopt a persona, but most are simple automatons.\n\n Constructed Nature.\n\nAn animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Homebrew **Sources:** [MM, page 19](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#animated%20armor_mm)\n\n\\\n",

Everyone\u2019s input, ideas, and creations are encouraged.\n* Everyone is responsible for everyone else having a good time and being included.\n* We will all strive to maintain immersion by keeping it an analog experience & focusing on the cooperative nature of the game. Telling other players how to play their character, meta-gaming, hogging the spotlight, arguing over everything, rules lawyering, etc. are counter to these goals.\n* The DM is the ultimate arbiter of what rules apply and how to interpret them. Asking for clarification in game is fine, but the appropriate venue for arguing over rules is in the chat between games.\n* Character sheets, character resources, and the mechanics of abilities are the player\u2019s responsibility to know and accurately track and be ready to use on their combat turn.\n* Off limits topics: none at this time.\n\n## Rolled Ability Scores\n\n\n1. Everyone writes down 3 character ideas that fit on an index card\n2. Everyone will roll the Random Standard Array Generator (PDF below)\n3. Players roll initiative and place character cards in initiative order. Players choose a stat block from the pile in that order.\n4.

The birth of magic just a few generations ago has accelerated the pace of everything. The Dwarven Kingdom wages it\u2019s third century of \u201c[short wars](/doc/short-wars-the-wars-begin-KRy7NuxEEY)\u201d beneath the stone streets, on a holy mission to eradicate the gnomish [resistance](/doc/adalind-rumblebelly-SLXdYH518j). Their war machine requires an endless supply of labor, supplies, and most of all\u2026 magic weapons. \\n\\nOver the city hangs an acrid cloud of arcane smog, a result of the elemental munitions factories that have sprung up everywhere. In the streets, dwarven military recruiters conscript any able-bodied adventurer they can find into the underground war effort. Outside the city walls, horrible beasts stalk their prey amidst a landscape that seems to change by the day. Despite the dangers, the promise of gold in every pocket has attracted the ambitious and foolish from all over the continent to this wretched place.\n\n# First & Last Chance Tavern\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=18360420-d680-4164-bbd1-8ab7ee22ee60)\n\nIn a quiet back alley, tucked against the city wall away from the bustle of the port and the military barracks, is a tavern known as *[Durradin](/doc/king-durradin-SGe3lRM9BN)\u2019s First & Last Chance.* Here every kind of rogue and sellsword gathers around tables for the chance to delve the depths of the tavern\u2019s most famous feature - the Yawning Portal - or as a last stop before heading out into the wilderness.\n\n> Hail and well met, traveler! First time here, yeah? I think I\u2019d remember that face - I\u2019m Brennan. Set your pack down and have a seat here at the bar.

We went that way last time and how did that turn out, genius? We don\u2019t even know if these scribbles actually lead somewhere other than the death of whoever drew this\u2026.\n\nIn a back corner, a dwarf in military dress sits warily at a booth, suspiciously eyeing the drunks who stumble past. He carefully examines the dagger an elvish woman has presented him through a loupe, and then counts out a stack of gold coins. They shake hands as he gets up to leave.\n\nBrennan enthusiastically and loudly rings a brass bell, and everyone in the bar turns expectantly toward the portal. The elevator is coming back up. It slowly rises into view, and on it is a friendly looking skeleton, standing amid a pile of gore and body parts.\n\n> Bob? Bob! What happened? All of them dead - seriously? The whole party? Damn the gods! They were good tippers\u2026\n>\n> `Bob the skeleton shrugs. `\\n`Brennan sighs as he wipes down the bar. `\\n`The patrons resume their conversations, disappointed.`\\nWhat\u2019ll it be friend - another drink?\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=b0b8be7b-8716-4bf9-98c8-b8761581632a)\n\n# Character Creation\n\n* Foundry character sheet is the ultimate source of truth\n* Start at Level 3\n* Any species, class, subclass, or spell from an official source is fair game\n* Ability Scores by [standard array or point buy](https://5e.dungeon.church/book.html#phb,1,3.%20determine%20ability%20scores)\n* Leveling by XP, Hit Points by manually rolling (or take average rounded up)\n* You should have a backup character ready at all times\n\n\\\n",

In dungeons, these cunning creatures most often take the form of doors and chests, having learned that such forms attract a steady stream of prey.\n\n***Imitative Predators***. Mimics can alter their outward texture to resemble wood, stone, and other basic materials, and they have evolved to assume the appearance of objects that other creatures are likely to come into contact with. A mimic in its altered form is nearly unrecognizable until potential prey blunders into its reach, whereupon the monster sprouts pseudopods and attacks.\n\nWhen it changes shape, a mimic excretes an adhesive that helps it seize prey and weapons that touch it. The adhesive is absorbed when the mimic assumes its amorphous form and on parts the mimic uses to move itself.\n\n***Cunning Hunters.*** Mimics live and hunt alone, though they occasionally share their feeding grounds with other creatures. Although most mimics have only predatory intelligence, a rare few evolve greater cunning and the ability to carry on simple conversations in Common or Undercommon. Such mimics might allow safe passage through their domains or provide useful information in exchange for food.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Homebrew\n\n**Sources:** !!Book!!, page !!number!!",

The stench is overwhelming. The figure points at Math with a rotten finger and exclaims that, \u201cWhere is your god now? One day the moon will not rise and darkness and chaos will reign. One day you will drink [Selune\u2019s](/doc/selune-wFfmk6l5Ba) blood and know the truth.\u201d\n\nThe figure cackles and drives Grayson and the others into a fright. The figure advances through the party and they are unable to attack him, even with the blows that land he laughs them off and heals before their eyes. [Gnolls](/doc/gnoll-OsI41zDuXb) come in from the room and rampage through the confined space, biting at the party with tooth and dagger. [Rot grubs](https://Rot Grub) drop from their mangy bodies. After eviscerating several of the party, the figure walks through the fight effortlessly and pushes a button on a dwarf statue, unleashing poison gas. He turns into a red mist and floats away as the poison indiscriminately kills.\n\nThey finish off the remaining gnolls and Krack keeps the gas at bay. In the room beyond they find a horrifying scene, the piles of viscera and unidentifiable body parts from the gnolls rampaging hunger are piled thigh high. The walls are covered in blood. Math sees only one thing: a nightingale bird, neatly pinned to the wall.\n\nGrayson notices something glimmer from what appears to be a gnoll head in the miasma of blood. He removes it and finds a gnomish watch of very high quality, fashioned into a dog collar. An engraving on the back reads \u201cL. Solmor\u201d\n\n# Amelia\u2019s Dinner\n\nThe party continues through the passages, trying to find a way further into the mine. They uncover beyond the passage blocked with trash and a large iron grate that there is an extremely large cavern with a staircase a hulking beast in the darkness.\n\nThey investigate a narrow passage they noticed before, assuming it ended in a cave in, but after squeezing through a narrow portion around a switchback, they come to find a small space with a wooden door. They ready themselves for the inevitable surprise that lies beyond, and they find a young woman sitting at an elaborately set table, ready for a feast.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=c29f1940-77a6-4478-97f9-ba2407ef39b9 \"left-50\") ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=2a37b279-3103-42cd-8136-69c392d4ab12 \"left-50\")\u201cOh just in time for dinner, I wasn\u2019t expecting guests, but I think I have enough food.

Please have some wine\u2026\u201d She tells Krack, \u201cOh yes I know [the Fens](https://lore.dungeon.church/doc/striborg-mZk9jSyJUV#h-the-fens) but it was such a long time ago, it was called something else then.\u201d\n\nKrack takes a sip and it turns to blood in her mouth. She notices if she looks at the food from the refracting candle light in the glass, she can see it\u2019s not food at all. It\u2019s some sort of illusion.\n\nMath wants to know if she\u2019s seen his brother [Lukas](/doc/lukas-woodenkeeper-MFwbJrVzOB). Amelia tells him that, \u201cOh yes he was with that group of [armored men](/doc/iron-riders-of-abraxas-P77pTaxjou) who came through. He did not seem to be having a good time with them, and we suggested he come to [Duskmire](/doc/duskmire-hJey19lfsu) to meet the [Lady Nightshade](/doc/lady-nightshade-3kjLNj2Zbs). She will be most interested in meeting such a special young man...\u201d\n\nAmelia wishes the party good luck in their endeavors, and turns into a bat and flies away. The food turns into a flayed and dismembered body on the table.\n\n# Deeper in the Mountain\n\nThe party discovers this room leads into the large cavern, and they are able to get around the slow and and not very intelligent monster, whom Krack distracts with a [Darkness](/doc/darkness-tYDAHpXMtw) spell. They follow a grand, ornate stone staircase down.. down\u2026 down.. to where it ends in a natural cavern. It seems water has broken through the ceiling, and it pools and quietly streams through this room with several passages leading off it. They investigate and get ambushed by [mud mephits](/doc/mud-mephit-6lLs92qaZU) in a narrow tunnel, who\u2019s sticky mud traps ensnare them. \n\nThey come to an extremely large cavern, several hundred yards across and many hundred of feet high. It glows with biolumniscent fungi and the glittering of crystals embedded in the ceiling. On the higher embankment they find themselves, they are surrounded with dwarven sepulchers. Math translate the runes: \u201cGlory to Those Who Could Not Make the Voyage\u201d\n\nThey follow a small path through the center of the large cavern, past giant mushrooms, and come to a decision: either north into a passageway, or south down a stone staircase. They choose north and find a small cave with a moldy skeleton - knowing better this time, they eradicate it with fire and take the longsword that bears the forge mark of [Durradin](/doc/king-durradin-SGe3lRM9BN).\n\nJust beyond they find a large doorway, battened from the outside. They decide to remove it, and out comes a raging owlbear. The party fights it off but soon several [giant chameleon lizards](https://Giant Chameleon) appear and attack the party. As Krack takes one down, the [owlbear](/doc/owlbear-kTCnClqfKW) sees it\u2019s opening and makes a run for it down a long tunnel.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=bf2a339b-feed-428e-9f73-6e758ebe3efd)\n\nThe party carefully follows, and discovers that it leads to the outside of the mountain, on the east side overlooking a small lake. It appears the lizards have been dragging animals in through this entrance.\n\n# The Dwarven Door\n\nBack into the mountain, the party further explores and finds at the far end of the massive cavern a huge iron door, bearing the image of a dwarf. There is a small key hole at dwarf height in it. Grayson attempts to pick it, but discovers it is quite the elaborate design. Not your ordinary lock.\n\nThe party decides to continue scouting the area, and they attempt to climb an embankment to see where a passage leads when they are ambushed by snake-like gricks. The party is mid-climb when they attack, and take many whips and slices as they fend them off from the low ground. As they retreat, the [gricks](/doc/grick-8WPnxoig9r) hiss and also go back into the hole they are defending.\n\nThe explore the southern staircase, and come to an underground stream that is moving rapidly into a hole in the floor on the eastern side of the cavern. A slick, slime covered staircase descends alongside it, and the party wraps themselves with their rope of climbing to make it down without slipping.\n\n# Underground River\n\nThe party finds themselves in a stone chamber, apparently ruptured by a flow of water that joins a massive, churning underground river in the next room. There are two doors in this one, the party opens one to find nothing but decay and dust. In the other, they find it swept clean, with lines of carefully laid out crates sealed with wax. Grayson cracks one open with his crowbar and they find very neatly packed weapons in straw - everything bearing the mark of Durradin, and any weapon they can think of. They exclaim their good fortune and take their new weapons. \n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=dcc8f9a1-a549-43d8-8dbd-da1ea57beff5)\n\nThey go through the southern door to where the underground river flows very rapidly and dangerously. A sturdy stone walkway crosses it, and on the other side they can see a passage and door. As they begin to cross it, [sahuagin](/doc/sahuagin-MkRLEKcGhh) emerge, point their tridents at the party, and shout in their shark-tongue\u2026\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=b9e6a9b9-971a-4261-94f4-cd250e62ab95)",

It gains its name from its long, powerfully built arms and legs, which end in wickedly curved hooked claws.\n\n***Echoes in the Dark.*** Hook horrors communicate by striking their hooks against their exoskeletons or the stone surfaces around them. What sounds to others like random clacking noise is actually a complex language that only hook horrors understand, and which carries for miles through the echoing Underdark.\n\n***Pack Predators.*** The omnivorous hook horrors eat lichens, fungi, plants, and any creature they can catch. A hook horror\u2019s hooked limbs give it excellent purchase on rock surfaces, and these creatures use their climbing skills to ambush prey from above.\n\nThey hunt in packs, working together against the largest and most dangerous opponents. If a battle goes poorly, a hook horror quickly climbs a cavern wall to flee.\n\n***Dedicated Clans.*** Hook horrors live in extended family groups or clans. Each clan is ruled by the eldest female, who typically places her mate in charge of the clan\u2019s hunters. Hook horrors lay eggs, which are clustered in a central, well-defended area of a clan\u2019s home caverns.\n\n\\\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Homebrew\n\n**Sources:** [MM, page 189](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#hook%20horror_mm)",

Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.\n\n***Age***. Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.\n\n***Alignment***. Dragonborn tend to extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic war between good and evil. Most dragonborn are good, but those who side with evil can be terrible villains.\n\n***Size***. Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.\n\n***Speed***. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\n**Table- Draconic Ancestry**\n\n| Dragon | Damage Type | Breath Weapon |\n|----|----|----|\n| Black | Acid | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) |\n| Blue | Lightning | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) |\n| Brass | Fire | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) |\n| Bronze | Lightning | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) |\n| Copper | Acid | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) |\n| Gold | Fire | 15 ft. cone (Dex. save) |\n| Green | Poison | 15 ft. cone (Con. save) |\n| Red | Fire | 15 ft. cone (Dex. save) |\n| Silver | Cold | 15 ft. cone (Con. save) |\n| White | Cold | 15 ft. cone (Con. save) |\n|    |    |    |\n\n***Draconic Ancestry***. You have draconic ancestry. Choose one type of dragon from the Draconic Ancestry table. Your breath weapon and damage resistance are determined by the dragon type, as shown in the table.\n\n***Breath Weapon***. You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.\n\nWhen you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.\n\nAfter you use your breath weapon, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.\n\n***Damage Resistance***. You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.\n\n***Languages***. You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.",

A form lurches into view, dragging one foot as it raises bloated arms and broken hands. The zombie advances, driven to kill anyone too slow to escape its grasp.\n\n***Dark Servants.*** Sinister necromantic magic infuses the remains of the dead, causing them to rise as zombies that do their creator's bidding without fear or hesitation. They move with a jerky, uneven gait, clad in the moldering apparel they wore when put to rest, and carrying the stench of decay.\n\nMost zombies are made from humanoid remains, though the flesh and bones of any formerly living creature can be imbued with a semblance of life. Necromantic magic, usually from spells, animates a zombie. Some zombies rise spontaneously when dark magic saturates an area. Once turned into a zombie, a creature can't be restored to life except by powerful magic, such as a resurrection spell.\n\nA zombie retains no vestiges of its former self, its mind devoid of thought and imagination. A zombie left without orders simply stands in place and rots unless something comes along that it can kill. The magic animating a zombie imbues it with evil, so left without purpose, it attacks any living creature it encounters.\n\n***Hideous Forms.*** Zombies appear as they did in life, showing the wounds that killed them. However, the magic that creates these vile creatures often takes time to run its course. Dead warriors might rise from a battlefield, eviscerated and bloated after days in the sun. The muddy cadaver of a peasant could claw its way from the ground, riddled with maggots and worms. A zombie might wash ashore or rise from a marsh, swollen and reeking after weeks in the water.\n\n***Mindless Soldiers.*** Zombies take the most direct route to any foe, unable to comprehend obstacles, tactics, or dangerous terrain. A zombie might stumble into a fast-flowing river to reach foes on a far shore, clawing at the surface as it is battered against rocks and destroyed. To reach a foe below it, a zombie might step out of an open window. Zombies stumble through roaring infernos, into pools of acid, and across fields littered with caltrops without hesitation.\n\nA zombie can follow simple orders and distinguish friends from foes, but its ability to reason is limited to shambling in whatever direction it is pointed, pummeling any enemy in its path. A zombie armed with a weapon uses it, but the zombie won't retrieve a dropped weapon or other tool until told to do so.\n\n***Undead Nature.*** A zombie doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.\n\n*After Beek died, we cast an animate dead spell on his corpse. It was fun for a while, but the zombie started to smell real bad, so we doused it in oil and set it on fire. Beek would've found that hilarious.*\u2014 Fonkin Hoodypeak, *on friendship*\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] [Source: Monster Manual page 316](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#beholder%20zombie_mm)\n\n\\\n",

After my father died, I left home; following the monks on their return to the monastery. There, I lived in secret for seemingly endless days and nights; hiding in between the walls and among the rafters. I passed the days and nights in silence, using my time to meditate, read tomes taken from the library, and trying to practice what little athletic and meditative skills I could glimpse from my tenuous position in the margins. I was discovered by a blind elder monk - [Atashi](/doc/atashi-atVd38Z9vD) - who tracked me through the walls and served as my first mentor. Over time, Atashi eventually convinced the masters to begin my formal training as part of the monastic order - the [Khaneye Jun Fan](/doc/the-khaneye-jun-fan-6tqXbPVyii).\n\nOlder than most acolytes and seen as an outsider with low social standing, I immersed myself in my training. The days were hard, and I afforded myself little time to rest - spending most evenings training on my own or with Atashi, where I learned more about the principles of Ki and how to find my \u201cone point\u201d - that center which brings balance. It was my belief that the balance I gained through the order and discipline of my practice would also bring balance, peace, and harmony to my life, my community, and the world.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=499c33b7-103c-4cf8-99a0-9fdd22fe9c7a \"left-50\")Atashi\u2019s faith in me was well-founded. I quickly moved up the ranks in the monastery and was entrusted with more responsibility. The years began to crawl by. Atashi died one winter of fever, and with no one else to talk to, I turned my attention to the workings of the monastic order itself. This attention revealed a rot deep within the order. I uncovered a conspiracy - the [Two of Wands](/doc/the-sunless-temple-3-two-of-wands-Ho3dEVzqz7) - among the abbot and his priors to use the monastery as a method of exerting political influence and exhorting money from the villagers in [Jhaampe](/doc/jhaampe-mCxU5WAN7q). My trust in the monastic order betrayed, I confronted the Abbot, and was exiled from the monastic order for my insubordination.\n\nI now wander between villages, again finding myself in the margins and trying find the balance anew. \n\n\\\n## **A Divine Revelation**\n\nTransported to the ancient city of Avalon [as it was attacked by the Dragon Emperor](/doc/session-26-the-doom-of-avalon-Ry02lBiLlv), I found myself naked; covered in oil; and half exploded by some construct crafted by some deranged elf (I can only assume). My consciousness wavered in the aftermath of the explosion, the ruins of the elven dungeon still smoldering around me and smoke choked my lungs. Pain radiated through my body, and as I closed my eyes I felt a warmth began to envelop me, like the first rays of dawn dispelling the cold of night.\n\nIn the darkness behind my closed eyes, a light emerged, growing steadily brighter until it consumed my vision. When I opened my eyes, I found myself in a vast expanse of golden light. The air was warm and fragrant, filled with the scent of blooming white flowers and the distant, melodious sound of a celestial choir accompanied by two harps.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=6b79ca73-ed7c-4c40-8502-e5b2a1f2d296 \"right-50 =299x523\")From the heart of the radiance, a figure began to take shape, her presence both awe-inspiring and comforting. Somehow I knew her - [Sarenrae, the Dawnflower](/doc/sarenrae-W8XCSaoR45) - a vision of celestial beauty and divine grace. Her golden hair flowed like liquid flame, and her bronze skin glowed with a soft, radiant light. In one hand, she held a scimitar ablaze with holy fire, and from the other hand, a gentle, healing light trickled down like liquid luminescence.\n\n\"Bahruhn,\" she spoke, and her voice served a soothing balm that eased my pain and filled my heart with peace. \"You have faced darkness and emerged scarred, but not broken. Know that your courage and compassion have not gone unnoticed.\" As she spoke, I felt my wounds begin to heal, the divine light knitting my flesh and restoring my strength. The light I found surrounding me suddenly seemed to radiate from inside me, as if there was no boundary between me and the goddess.\n\n\u201cSarenrae, my goddess\u201d I spoke \u201cWhat shall you have me do?\u201d\n\nSarenrae extended both hands - she touched her scimitar to the side of my face, and reached out with her hand full of light as a dove emerged. I reached out to accept the dove, and my vision shifted - I was now standing on a high tower overlooking a vast valley. In my hand, I held two spears - the Two of Wands - at the start of yet another journey. \n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=4476078f-ef44-44f6-b57f-bd18cb8d54c4 \"left-50 =269x471\")\n\nSarenrae\u2019s voice again entered my mind. \"The Two of Wands represents a time of decision and the power of your vision. You stand at the threshold of new opportunities - many possible worlds lay before you. You accept these gifts, and must continue to walk the path of compassion and temperance. Be the healing flame that brings light to the darkest places, and the spear that delivers swift justice to those beyond redemption. Remember that even in the face of great evil, redemption is always a possibility, but so too must justice be served. As you serve this cause; I will be watching to ensure you fulfill this potential.\"\n\nHer visage returned to mine, and with a final radiant smile, Sarenrae faded into the field of light, and I found myself again in the smoldering ruins of the dungeon, still charred, but filled with a new sense of purpose and the warmth of the Dawnflower\u2019s blessing. My path was clear - to bring hope and justice to the world, for Sarenrae. \n\nNow to find out who made that exploding construct\u2026\n\n\\\n\\\n",

Human ambition is embodied in the prosperous merchant city of [Striborg](/doc/striborg-mZk9jSyJUV). Ruled by an aristocratic merchant class, with a rising religious-populous movement in the streets, Striborg has become a place increasingly unwelcome to those not committed to human partisanship in some form. Most humans do not live in Striborg though, but in simple settlements throughout the continent. These people are driven by more basic motivations: farmers, craftsmen, travelers, scholars, and adventurers.\n>\n> \\-[Zine #1](/doc/zine-M6fH6HgpLE)\n\n### Human Traits\n\nIt's hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character has these traits.\n\n***Ability Score Increase***.

Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\n\n***Speed***. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\n***Languages***. You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.",

The host drips blood from its ears, nose, eyes, or from a wound that resembles the injury done to the sap demon's tree (1 damage/Hour). Damage inflicted on the host has no effect on the sap demon. If the host dies or is reduced to 0 hit points, the sap demon must leave the body within one hour.\n\n\n---\n\n*When a sap demon leaves a tree, its milky amber fluid oozes from an axe wound on a stout maple's trunk and shapes itself into a small, vaguely humanoid form on the forest floor beside the tree. This languid creature half walks and half flows forward, implacably following the axe wielder's path to certain revenge.*\n\n Tree Oozes.\n\nSap demons aren't true demons, but rather are intelligent oozes that form when an enchanted tree is cut or injured. Though typically Small, the larger the sap source is, the larger the resulting creature can be. Over a few hours, they pool into a shape that vaguely resembles their tree's attacker: for instance, if the tree cutter wore a hat, then a hat may be incorporated into the sap demon's overall shape. The similarity is faint at best; no one would ever confuse a sap demon for the creature it hunts, because its shape has no sharp features or color other than amber.\n\nCalled to Vengeance.\n\nSap demons can pummel their prey with partially-crystallized fists, but they especially enjoy claiming the weapon that wounded their tree and wielding it to deliver a final blow. Once their prey is destroyed, most sap demons return to their tree, but not all do. Some are curious or malevolent enough to explore the world further.\n\nReckless Possessors.\n\nA sap demon can possess another creature by grappling it and oozing down its throat. Once inside, the sap demon dominates its host and makes it bleed as the tree bled. Since the sap demon takes no damage when its host is wounded, it's free to be as reckless as it likes. It might wander into a town to cause trouble. However, no matter how its new body is bandaged or cured, it never stops bleeding slowly. If the host body is killed, the sap demon oozes out during the next hour and either returns to its tree or seeks another host.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Homebrew\n\n**Sources:** [Tome of Beasts, page 335](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#sap%20demon_tob)",

To stock up at the shop at the opposite end of town, or just set out on the road for the 4 mile trek to the site of the old [haunted house](/doc/alchemists-house-D0Oo2ziTIj)? [Lankus](/doc/lankus-kurrid-Fp2Q3VBXoV) provides some town gossip and breakfast beer. Suddenly in the door, a very damp gnome appears. [Panteleon](/doc/panteleon-thorngage-9YcdfHf4au) has also survived the journey, out of his mushroom fugue, and arrives damp in the bar leaving tiny wet footprints behind him. The party updates him on their plans.\n\n[Ovond](/doc/ovond-TcGmrYFz2k), a dwarf with no eyebrows, appears at the bar and seems very nervous that he will be seen running late for work at the mine. He compulsively stuffs the food Lankus brings into his mouth and chews as he talks. He complains about the working conditions as he scans the patrons looking for familiar faces to avoid. Suddenly, [Manistrad Copperlocks](/doc/manistrad-copperlocks-W9uyiYutrl) - which the party recognizes from the solstice court -  kicks in the door, smashes her hammer on the floor, and yells:\n\n> Aight you lazy fucks get your asses out of them stools and back to work! I don\u2019t care how much you had to drink last night the party\u2019s over!\n\nAs the dwarves in the building gather their pickaxes and headlamps and begin to sulk out, Ovond attemps to hide behind Tharac\u2019s hulking form to make his exit.\n\n# The Haunted House\n\nThe party eventually decides to just go for it, Tharac\u2019s preference for headlamps not withstanding. Panteleon is always down for possible treasure. They head south from town, following the road that hugs the rocky coast. Low clouds hang over the water, a humid summer day. They soon come to see their blind ship\u2019s navigator, [Moldar](/doc/moldar-deepbeard-3xYoIqB64Y), riding a goat backwards also headed south. He tells them he is headed toward the hamlet of [Havong](/doc/havong-zTmSPWVPVA), where many of his dwarven kin live.\n\nThe road splits off and [the abandoned house](/doc/alchemists-house-D0Oo2ziTIj) looms on a hillside bluff overlooking the ocean\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=fdcfac7c-5038-4b2b-8cbe-5a3e11aae26a)\n\n## Weasel Punching\n\nThe party comes to the dilapidated and collapsed stone wall surrounding the house, encasing a garden that obviously was once upon a time well tended. Indeterminate tomato vines form random piles in the yard, and a water well stands in the center. At the bottom of the well, something glints gold, and the base of the well is surrounded by small animal remains. This proves too much to resist for the party and they attempt to lower Panteleon into the well by tying a rope around his waist and lowering him in. But as they prepare this, out of a large thorny rose bush a group of [weasels](/doc/weasel-eHLaFvqyns) attacks Pants, bear hugging him and forming a weasel chain attempting to grapple him back into their hole.\n\nPants responds by using Speak with Small Beasts, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d the weasel attached to him licks his wounds and whispers in his ear: *YOUR BLOOD*\n\nTwo [poisonous snakes](/doc/poisonous-snake-Wmspf4tRSF) slither out of the well. The party is engaged in a full fledged tug of war with the weasels, who grapple Pants, and the party who tugs on the rope attached to his waist. After trading blows and tugs, the weasels retreat or go flying as Tharac rages and yanks the rope.\n\nUnfortunately, this corners Pants with a snake, and he goes down and unconscious from the bite.\n\nAfter an embarrassingly long battle between the snakes & weasels fighting the party, the party finally drives them off, with Math healing Panteleon before he succumbs to his wounds.\n\nAfter all this trouble, Krack simply sends her [mage hand](/doc/mage-hand-1nhwE5UUt3), which Math [lights up with his cantrip](/doc/light-lhQCDEW6iD) so the party can see it\u2019s descent down the well to retrieve the gold at the bottom. As the hand descends through the well\u2019s tunnel, snakes lash out at it\u2019s ghastly form and pass straight through it harmlessly. The gold pieces are retrieved.\n\n## Into the House\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=fade044f-cc46-42b6-96d5-69b0cfbe5d08)\n\nThe party enters the house through a back door, leading to the kitchen (9) and scullery (10) area. They investigate and find foot prints leading from the main entrance (1) down into a cellar. There is also a staircase up to the second floor, but they decide to clear the house room by room.\n\nThey do so - burning spiders up in a fireplace (8), going through the centipede infested cupboards of the kitchen(9), and more curiously, finding a chicken in the rotten dining room (7).\n\nPants attempts to interpret the chicken\u2019s intent but all he really gets is \u201cTROLL\u201d and \u201cTRAPPED\u201d and some other words up to interpretation.\n\n\\\nThey clear the remaining rooms, and are especially interested in the old library (2). While exploring, the party hears a thumping noise from upstairs. They pick through the rotting and moldy books and heaving shelves to find volumes that might be interesting and come up with several:\n\n* A book about mushrooms\n* A history of the First [Dragon Emperor](/doc/dragon-empire-odzVqtQPbm)\n* The Short Wars: Gnomes & Dwarven Conflict\n* The Metaphysics of Metal\n\nIn the other rooms they find mushrooms (5), fireplaces, hidden compartments containing potions of healing and small trinkets (3). Of the more curious things they find: two identical chicken statuettes, the size of chess pieces, wrapped in a leather pouch behind a loose brick in the fireplace (5). One is solid gold, the other is a strange metal. When Krack touches it, she feels it numb her hand and shiver up her nervous system in a negative way. The others do not have this effect.\n\nIn the western living room (4), they are suddenly assaulted by a voice:\n\n> YOUR DOOM AWAITS!   BWAHAHAHA\n\nHalf of the party is so frightened they leave the room, scared. They retreat to the main hall.\n\n## Upstairs\n\nPants decides to ascend the porch and check out the upstairs from outside. As he repels up and looks in the window, he sees a bound and gagged man on the floor of a small room.\n\nSeeing that the larger comrades can\u2019t make it up the way the gnome did, they decide to ascend the staircase inside. They go upstairs very, very carefully and find that the room the bound man is in is locked. Pants unsuccessfully picks it, although he notes it appears to be recently oiled.\n\nThey go one door down and find that this room has partly caved in. After investigation, in the late afternoon light they see that there are footprints hugging the wall, avoiding the damaged floor, leading to the window.\n\nAs the party is creeping along, both Math & Tharac manage to just faceplant themselves straight through the weak floor and into the room below, landing on top of each other and sustaining damage. Krack sneaks past the newly opened hole in the floor and discovers a telescoping eyeglass hanging just outside the window frame, and notes that this room offers the best view of the coast and boats passing. Pants throws a rope down and pulls the others back up.\n\n## 2 Coin\n\nThe party now finally united in their task, step out onto the narrow balcony that surrounds the upper floor of the building. They creep up to the window and see the the bound man, who appears to not have any weapons nearby, seeing as he is naked and inside a locked room. They climb through the window and confront him.\n\nThe party frees his gag and he exclaims/explains,\n\n> \u201cBy god thank you! I have been trapped here and have soiled myself! I am 2 Coin - I was passing by on the road and thought this house might provide shelter. Upon seeing it\u2019s derelict state, I attempted to stay the night inside but was clubbed on the back of the head by them/it! Then I woke up here!\n\nThe party decides to lend him some clothes, and as the sun is very low and setting on the horizon, they decide to head back toward the road where it\u2019s safe. To rest, camp, and plot their next move\u2026.\n\n\\\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=83f2d66e-677f-499d-999d-6e693dffabbd)\n\n\\\n",

Each friendly creature within 30 feet of the animated instrument that can hear the song has a +1 bonus to attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until the song ends. The animated instrument must take a bonus action on subsequent turns to continue playing the song. It can stop playing at any time. The song ends if the animated instrument is incapacitated. A creature can benefit from only one Courageous Anthem at a time.\n\n## Animated Instrument\n\n> The piano began to play a tune on its own, and the tavern patrons turned to look. The piano then floated upward, clipping a startled waiter, and everyone in the tavern turned to flee.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=520fbce1-2fb1-437c-8d0c-e015d643a1f0 \"right-50\")Delicate in frame but clever in design, animated instruments are crafted with formidable magic to serve maestros and savants for purposes ranging from bodyguards to performance backup. Favored by bards, nobles, and virtuoso liches these often-beautiful works of craftsmanship are designed and imbued with magical effects that can enthrall, confuse, and even terrify listeners.\n\nAny instrument is suitable for animation, though some are more common than others. Lutes, flutes, and other more compact instruments are prime candidates for traveling bards. Pianos and harpsichords make for excellent guards in the homes of the wealthy. Horns and drums are often chosen for armies on battlegrounds to bolster weary soldiers and frighten oncoming enemies.\n\n***Compelling Melodies.*** Songs of wondrous power are woven into the enchantments that impart the chosen instrument with unique musical gifts. Other times, usually when an instrument is enchanted in haste, the instrument recalls the pieces of music it was used to play when it was only an object. In any case, the animated instrument can play magical melodies. All animated instruments, even the simplest of harps or tambourines, can strike at unruly listeners with thunderous effect and charming melodies.\n\n***Menacing Harmonies.*** An animated instrument alone is more than enough for most heroes to handle, but not all instruments are brought to life for solo acts. Just as often, formidable quartets of instruments are created, typically horns or drums. Quartets act with unified purpose in accordance with their enchanter's instructions and do so in perfect harmony. Though most animated instruments are seen alone or as a quartet, animated instruments' capacity for animation is limited only by the arcane aptitude and creativity of the enchanter.\n\n***Mighty Symphonies.*** Truly magnificent works of art and sorcery, animated symphonies are massive swarms of animated instruments. The magic required to uplift entire symphonies is both mighty and rare. In all cases, animated symphonies develop hive-mind egos that are twisted caricatures of the composers who wrote for the instruments or that are rooted in the style of music their individual components played before their transmutation. The personalities of these symphonies are as varied as the music of the world.",

Born with neither intrinsic magical abilities nor the aptitude for wizardly scholarship, Cirrilla obtained her arcane powers by entering into a warlock pact with [Daemon](/doc/daemon-6UihrCJ5sX). Cirrilla was originally an anti-dragon hardliner, believing that the liberation of Pyora from the stranglehold of the [dragon emperor](/doc/dragon-empire-odzVqtQPbm) required the eradication of dragons and dragonborn alike. This position changed substantially after a chance meeting with [Razorback the Uniter](/doc/razorback-the-uniter-O3oe7NBQqK), who exposed her to the horrendous conditions experienced by the dragonborn slaves, and convinced her that only through mutual liberation was true freedom possible.\u00a0\n\n\\nThe two formed a secret alliance (as Razorback\u2019s true intentions were not yet known to the dragon overlords). For years, they maintained an undercover correspondence while both Cirilla and Razorback recruited others to their cause. These communal efforts culminated in the ambush on [Drusilla](/doc/drusilla-ggRgUzwcwN). Using schematics of Drusilla\u2019s lair acquired by Razorback, the trusted partners, along with a small team of allies, embarked on a high risk, high reward mission to take out the amethyst monster. Cirilla sacrificed her life to save the rest of the team and ensure the success of the mission. The wild magic explosion generated from the battle was sufficient to kill Drusilla and cleave part of Cirrilla\u2019s soul from her mortal body, after which it embedded itself into her ring.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\n\n\nRace: High Elf\n\nClass: Warlock\n\nPatron: [Daemon](/doc/daemon-6UihrCJ5sX)\n\nPlace of Birth: [Avalon](/doc/avalon-7amKaC2AMg)\u00a0\n\nPlace of Death: Drusilla\u2019s Lair\n\nAlignment: Chaotic Neutral",

Some people still sympathize with the old order, and desire to turn back the clock to the time when the [Dragon Emperors](/doc/dragon-empire-odzVqtQPbm) ruled. Others are simply obsessed with the power of the dragons and misguidedly long for a world in which they still roam.\n\nThe Red Talon Society seeks to eliminate these reactionary hold outs and prevent them from gaining any influence in the world. The society\u2019s members are made up of [halflings](/doc/halfling-fFZiVbQDbC) descended from an elite group of guerilla rangers that fought against the [Empire](/doc/dragon-empire-odzVqtQPbm). They carry on the mission of their forefathers, using their small size and survival skills to surgically strike and ambush their enemies. They consider themselves the keepers of a sacred tradition and the living embodiment of their warrior lineage. They are committed to creating a just world above ground for everyone.\n\n## Organization\n\nGroups are not centrally coordinated but rather are small chapters, each led by the eldest halfling who is able to trace their family line back to one of the original warriors. This person bears \u201c[The Red Talon](/doc/the-red-talon-JmZrNqSkRX)\u201d - the claw of a dead dragon, dipped in it\u2019s own blood, passed down through generations.\n\nIn polite society they operate as a benevolent association for halflings, honoring the memory of their heroes, with only a wink and nod to the \u201clegends\u201d of their current day escapades. They use their resources to help gnomes leaving the underground to assimilate into above ground society, and place a heavy emphasis on genealogy, often operating libraries of gnomish/halfling texts and records.\n\n## Symbols\n\nThe Society uses the symbol of the hawk or the hawk\u2019s talons in maroon red, a symbol of the limitless sky in the above ground world, and also a hunter of lizards.\n\n\\\n\n---\n\n## Rolled\n\n[ https://www.reddit.com/r/BehindTheTables/comments/3xyilr/secret_societies/]( https://www.reddit.com/r/BehindTheTables/comments/3xyilr/secret_societies/)\n\n* Main goal: hunt down dragon sympathizers \n* Led by: dangerous megalomaniac\n* Members recognize each other by: a subtle pin or piece of jewelry\n* Society\u2019s colors are: maroon\n* Society\u2019s symbol: a bird - hawk\n* They champion the ideal of : Duty\n* Members of this society operate: in small groups, but openly\n* Members of this society typically know: several other members of the society\n* Members of the society occasionally gather to meet in: residence of the leader\n* Gold to support his addiction (d4): 1. drinking; 2. gambling; 3. harlots; 4. smoking.\n* The society\u2019s membership is primarily made up of: members of a particular class (halfling rangers)\n\n\\\n",

A [grappled](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#grappled_phb) creature takes 2 (`1d4`) piercing damage at the end of the child's turn for as long as it remains [grappled](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#grappled_phb).\n\n\n---\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=aae17659-6c6c-42d3-9ccd-0716ab6eb5c1)**Born of Magic**. Children of the briar are a frequent nuisance to fey and mortal alike. They grow in deep briar patches in forest clearings or along sunny hillsides and riverbanks. More rarely, they spawn when a [sorcerer](https://www.5esrd.com/classes/sorcerer) or magical creature\u2019s blood is spilled on the forest floor, or when summoned into being by obscure druidic items of power.\n\n**Thorn Fortresses**. Despite their size, children of the briar gather in great numbers, cultivating ancient forest thickets into veritable fortresses. Wise men flee when they hear the clicking language in the underbrush, for children of the briar have the capricious wickedness of spiteful children and a taste for blood.\n\n**Spies and Scouts**. From their lairs, children of the briar creep far and wide to spy on the forest\u2019s inhabitants, sometimes using spiders, monstrous centipedes, and giant dragonflies as mounts. They converse with travelers bearing interesting news, but their words are thorned with gleeful malice, jealous bile, and lies. They are not above murder. They trade news and gossip for trinkets, favors, and drops of spilled blood.\n\n**Fey Blessed**. The fey have long used children of the briar as spies and informants. The power of the fey courses through their veins, allowing them to work simple magical tricks and slip between the mortal and fey realms with relative ease.\n\n\n---\n\n- [x] Homebrew **Sources:** Kobold [Tome of Beasts 1, page 56](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#child%20of%20the%20briar_tob,fbmt:sand\\~b1\\~b0,flstsource:hftt=1\\~rmbre=1\\~aatm=1\\~aitfr-isf=1\\~aitfr-thp=1\\~aitfr-dn=1\\~aitfr-fcd=1\\~awm=1\\~coa=1\\~crcotn=1\\~dod=1\\~dodk=1\\~egw=1\\~ghloe=1\\~gotsf=1\\~hat-tg=1\\~hwcs=1\\~imr=1\\~llk=1\\~lr=1\\~mabjov=1\\~mcv1sc=1\\~mcv2dc=1\\~mcv3mc=1\\~mcv4ec=1\\~mismv1=1\\~mff=1\\~mgelft=1\\~nrh-tcmc=1\\~nrh-avitw=1\\~nrh-ass=1\\~nrh-coi=1\\~nrh-tlt=1\\~nrh-awol=1\\~nrh-at=1\\~psa=1\\~psd=1\\~psi=1\\~psk=1\\~psx=1\\~psz=1\\~rtg=1\\~sads=1\\~tdcsr=1\\~ttp=1\\~vd=1\\~hfstcm=1\\~sja=1\\~lk=1\\~lrdt=1\\~tob1-2023=1,flopsource:extend)\n\n\\\n",

Attracted to rotting material, the swarm spreads a fast-acting, poison on its victims, creating carrion it can feed on immediately.\n\n**Devour the Undead.**\n\nUndead creatures are not immune to a death butterfly swarm's poison, and a swarm can rot an undead creature's animating energies as easily as those of the living. Given the choice between an undead and living creature, a death butterfly swarm always attacks the undead. Such swarms find ghouls and vampires particularly appealing. Some good-aligned forces regard summoning these swarms as a necessary evil.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Homebrew\n\n**Sources:** [Kobold Tome of Beasts, page 71](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#death%20butterfly%20swarm_tob)",

[Manistrad Copperlocks](/doc/manistrad-copperlocks-W9uyiYutrl) is here and she continues pounding on the door until it falls in off it\u2019s hinges. She\u2019s pissed.\n\nShe gives the party a few of her thoughts, about how they outbid her at the auction and that she\u2019s not fooled by their reputation in town. But actually since they\u2019re being so helpful for every one else\u2026 maybe they could quietly help her with a problem with [the mine](/doc/the-old-mine-ndIfgvk1B6)? They are very far behind schedule because they tried blowing out a monster and they think they just made it angrier.

She says to keep it discrete, and not to take anything from the mine. Just clear out the problem monsters. The party agrees and heads out up the fork in the road towards the mountain.\n\n# Mine Camp\n\nAfter hiking most of the day through pine forests and small vales on the carriage rutted road still damp from last night\u2019s storm, they come to a plateau near the top Stone Tooth peak and see the Mining Camp.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=18354e9b-cb4b-489e-a94a-bc99b9dec21a)The camp is surrounded by a lazily built wall from rock detritus removed from the mine, and two guard shacks stand aside a wooden gate just big enough for a cart to fit through. Two [Iron Riders](/doc/iron-riders-of-abraxas-P77pTaxjou) stand at attention and stop the party.\n\n\u201cHail and well met!\u201d the guards call out. \u201cPapers please.\" The party produces the union card and is let in without a problem.\n\nInside the wall there\u2019s a central, muddy yard with a smoldering fire, some military barrack tents at the back in a neat line, a small area of merchant carts and shacks, and a bustling, loud tarp canopy tavern to the west.\n\n### Durandar Arms Dealer\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=62aa0062-dd6e-4609-9abc-add2737e1f2d \"left-50\")The party decides to pick up some supplies at the market. They find a merchant with a shield hanging over his carriage showing the mark of [Durandar](/doc/durandar-sWDxZHDVIC). His shop is immaculately kept, well lit, and on the shelves behind him sit a dazzling array of extremely high quality weapons and supplies, all very expensive.\n\nThe party looks at some of the wares and buys a few fine items with their cash - a [Minor Belt of Dwarvenkind](/doc/minor-belt-of-dwarvenkind-7pgPJfXTwh), a dagger for Grayson that grants some darkvision, and they stock up on potions.\n\nThe dwarf [Morfeal ](/doc/morfeal-4LpA2YXrFq)grumbles about having to set up shop so far out of town, and about the \u201cdesecrators\u201d who work in the mines to destroy their own heritage for a bit of coin.\n\n### Miner\u2019s Respite\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=6715a7bf-a15a-4d16-a9a4-c9a42b927c02 \"left-50\")After spending a bunch of their money, the party heads over to the \u201cbar\u201d which is really just a giant A-frame tarp between two large boulders. They can hear the noise of dwarves who definitely do not have to work in the morning.\n\nInside they survey the crowd and see their blind friend [Moldar](/doc/moldar-deepbeard-3xYoIqB64Y) from the [Grinning Wyrm](/doc/session-1-welcome-to-saltmarsh-IyV6iGiiKu). He is perched on a bar stool like a king, with a giant stack of coins in front of him. Apparently his winnings from the darts, which go on at the back of the bar. Moldar raises one finger in the air and the barkeep immediately brings 4 ales for his friends. They ask him what he\u2019s doing up here and he informs them that he needed to get away from the ocean (and stop playing darts) because the \u201cmoons are no good.\u201d\n\nMath cannot resist the call of the darts and pretty much immediately heads over to see a human Iron Rider named Callum and a dwarf arguing about who is supposed to buy the next round, the winner or the loser. Math steps in and proceeds to play darts extremely poorly, as does the inebriated Iron Rider. When asked about what\u2019s going on at the mine he tells the party they\u2019ve sent in 3 crews of Iron Riders to fight off whatever is down there and not a single man has returned. He said they thought because of the pranks - poop sculptures found in supervisors offices and that sort of thing - that it \u201cmust be the usual union problems\u201d Or at least that\u2019s what they thought until people start disappearing. He also mentions the Rider teams were sent in to the \u201csecond level\u201d but now it was difficult to access at all with the passage blown out by explosives.\n\n### Night Ambush\n\nThe party decides to set out for the mine in the morning and to rest at the miner\u2019s tent barracks so they can attempt to attune to their new treasures. They fit on the dwarf sized bunks as best they can.\n\nIn the middle of the night, they are awakened by shouts and commotion from outside. A bright light erupts - a fire somewhere in the camp has broken out! They leave the tent to see on the hills surrounding this encampment a [horned humanoid figure](/doc/lamont-solmar-GLrWBoIX5h), riding a goat, wildly shooting fire arrows into the camp at random with two other figures cloaked in animal skins.\n\nThe party attempts to volley back, most successfully with Krack\u2019s [Magic Missile](/doc/magic-missile-9QICWIX4gV). But it does little to stop the marauders, as two are seen dashing to run around the outskirts of the camp, using the trees as cover.\n\nThe main horned figure summons a burning sword in the sky, and sends it down into the camp, slicing the Miner\u2019s Respite in two and setting it ablaze as it swings at the party and just barely misses. But now the whole camp is nearly on fire, and dwarves run around everywhere with buckets of water.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=d0cf478b-cb3a-43ec-b22f-89adb0010eaf)\n\nThe two cloaked figures run around each side of the camp and fling a foul, poo-like substance into the camp. As soon as it hits the ground it sizzles and releases a poisonous gas. Math is overcome and begins to vomit repeatedly as he is caught in it. He is forced to lay hands on himself repeatedly to get back into the fight. But by then it\u2019s too late.\n\nThe mysterious goatman and his cloaked figures make a run for it into the cover of the dark forest, leaving the camp to frantically undo the damage that has been done. The burning spectral weapon dissipates into smoke. The party runs over to join a bucket line of dwarves who are attempting to put out the fire on the Miner\u2019s Respite. They ask if this has ever happened before and the dwarf just tells them \u201cI\u2019ve heard tales of weird things in the woods but nothing like this.\u201d\n\n# The Mine\n\nLeaving the smoldering camp behind the party treks up the hill and decides to see what\u2019s going on at the peak with the thin plume of smoke. After bushwhacking through some rocky sagebrush, they find a hole in the peak that forms a natural chimney. Sulfur-ish smoke wafts out of it. They decide this is probably not a good entrance.\n\nBack to the main road, which they find unattended, they walk into the natural crevasse of the Stone Tooth and as they turn into the mountain are met with a magnificent stone door. Above it Math translates the Dwarvish text: \u201cThe Forge of [Durradin](/doc/king-durradin-SGe3lRM9BN)\u2019s Kingdom\u201d\n\nKrack slips into the darkness beyond the door to scout with her darkvision. What she sees is an absolutely massive chamber, with the floor blown out in the middle by some sort of explosion. She can just barely see the other side of the room. The pit seems bottomless. There are two ropes strung across the pit and it\u2019s not possible to see what the other side is attached to.\n\nThe rest of the party joins her and discusses their options. They decide that the rogue Grayson should go out first since he\u2019s the smallest. He makes it about halfway across before Krack senses motion on the other side of the crevasse, and Grayson feels an undeniable\u2026 *tap tap tap* on the rope from the other side. He realizes they are not alone, and begins to high tail it back the way he came. From the other side they see color balls of magical light appear and begin to circle the rope in a spiral headed toward Grayson.

She feels a surge of magic and for the first time loses control, aiming her rage at the wall.\n\nThey barricade the door by pushing the desk in front of it, and lay down to sleep in the small room. \n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=b0e62fd3-c7b5-4aeb-912e-01d49926adcf)\n\n\\\n# Trapped\n\nTharac is nearest to the door, and is woken up in the middle of the night by his [danger sense](https://Danger) - he smells smoke! Apparently there is a fire outside the door! He wakes the party and they look around inside the solid stone room they now are trapped in with no escape. They decide to open the door, but as soon as Tharac touches the handle, the wood of the door creaks and bends into the unholy shape of a giant skull. It\u2019s mouth clatters: *YOUR DEATH IS MY PLEASURE!* As smoke pours through it\u2019s empty, lifeless eye sockets and rotten teeth.\n\n\\\nMath steps in and calls on [Selune](/doc/selune-wFfmk6l5Ba) to Turn Undead\u2026. But nothing happens? The door flies open, pouring smoke and flame into the room. The party is trapped. Outside the door a giant skeleton has jammed itself into the hallway. It reaches in with a giant hand and just barely misses Krack. Tharac raises his mighty great axe and brings it\u2019s weight slamming down into the skull\u2026. But it just passes straight though. The skeleton laughs as the illusion dissipates and the very real fire burns hotter.\n\n\\\nKrack decides to make a run for it, there\u2019s no escape in this room. She wraps her cloak around her and sprints through the hallway dodging flames best she can. As soon as she steps into the burning hallway, she feels her feet slip. Ball bearings. She manages to slide across the floor and not lose her balance, but then just before reaching safety from the flames\u2026. Caltrops under foot. Math and Tharac both attempt the same dance with less success, Pants more so as he carefully steps across the now well known obstacles. They hear a snicker from across the great barracks hall this cellar has become: It\u2019s fucking [2 Coin.](/doc/2-coin-NSUizjoWgU) And 2 Coin is accompanied by a dwarf, and both of them have crossbows aimed at the very exposed party.\n\n\\\nThe party takes a few shots and Krack especially suffers damage. She unleashes [Magic Missiles](https://Magic) at the two betrayers. The dwarf falls, and 2 Coin obviously fucked up, makes a run for it into the secret passage behind the staircase.\n\n# The Tunnels\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=d7fa354d-a82f-44f0-bdd1-450a5208f8af)\n\nThe party follows and first inspects the body of the fallen dwarf. He has a bottle of Essence of Ether and evidence of a spent spell scroll lies on the ground. 2 Coin has left a trail of blood, leading into natural caverns in the stone beneath the house. They all proceed into the darkness, and hear the sound of running water deep and realize that the tunnels are leading down in elevation\u2026 Math casts Light so that they can see and examine the ground and they find more blood leading further into this dank and smelly place.\n\nPants sees a rat munching on some garbage in the corner. He asks him (using [Speak with Animals](/doc/speak-with-animals-g0PInjgOVl)): *Where did they go?* \n\nThe rat responds: to the food paradise.\n\n*How many are there?*\n\nThe rat: 2 big ones, bunch of little ones. Follow me I\u2019ll show you\u2026.\n\n\\\nThe rat disappears into a small crack in the wall.\n\n\\\nThe party continues, and the path diverges to the left. An underground creek into which sewage drains runs beneath a makeshift crossing made out of trash. They investigate, and the blood trail continues forward. They follow.\n\nThe come to another divergent path and this time they aren\u2019t sure which way to go. They see light around a corner, and are greeted with solid iron bars with a giant lock on them standing in the way. Arrows rain down on them almost immediately. On the other side of the bars, they see a dwarf scuttling out of a doorway with a barrel on his back, running in a hurry further into the labyrinth.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=23230f7e-ad55-4b55-bcbe-fbcc2b28fe14)\n\nThe party falls back. They decide to split up, with Math and Tharac examining the previous intersection to see if they can find a way around this blockade that\u2019s safer. They follow an underground waterway about 30 feet down a stone passage, into a room where the water deepens and multiple drains converge. They see something gold glinting in the darkness, and cannot help but investigate. They find a small locket, with a tuft of hair, with the inscription \u201cWith Love, 2 Coin\u201d.\n\n\\\nIn the darkness above them, stirges wait for their moment to strike, and Tharac gets one stuck in his neck almost immediately, sucking his blood. Math uses a [Minor Illusion](https://Minor) to create the figure of a very fat, plump dwarf, and the rest of the stirges cannot resist. They plunge to the ground, hitting the stone beneath the water hard. The rest of the party hears clanging and yelling and wonders what the hell is going on.\n\n# The Smugglers\n\nThey rejoin their comrades and instead think this time maybe they should get their rogue friend Pants to attempt the lock. Using old furniture for cover, Pants sneaks in with his lockpicking tools and\u2026. His hands go straight through the lock. It\u2019s another illusion.\n\n\\\nThe party rushes through the fake bars and busts into the well lit room, to find several dwarves hurriedly packing up cargo in the form of barrels, boxes, and casks. One dwarf on top of some scaffolding fires a crossbow and gets in a good shot, another tips a barrel of rum at the party below and misses. Math uses [Command](https://Comm) and 2 of the dwarves have the sudden urge to tackle the one on the scaffolding. Predictably, 2 of them fall and slip to their demise (\u201cLove live Durandar, bleghhhh\u201d). The other surrenders and tells the party, \u201cJust take the loot, I don\u2019t care!\u201d\n\nThe party holds him at knife point. Who are they? He explains they heard the party coming and were attempting to peacefully get out before discovered. They are simple merchants on a charitable mission to move some cargo, wink wink, and Boss Man wants them to do it pronto.\n\nWith some threats of violence, the dwarf agrees to show them to the Boss Man and leads them further into the earth. The passage opens up and into a large cavern, a sea cave, where a small boat is anchored to a rock. 2 hobgoblins and a bunch of dwarves are loading barrels onto the ship under the direction of an absurdly dressed dwarf wizard with a large brooch holding up his many colored cloak. The hobgoblins draw their swords when they see the party approach.\n\n# The Sanbalet & Crew\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=b4f18e1c-a396-4d19-88c9-73c19249311d)\n\n\u201cHalt! [The Sanbalet ](/doc/the-sanbalet-Zt2T42UM2E)does not condone violence, what is the meaning of this?\u201d The wizard dwarf asks. \u201cWe are just using this house temporarily, it belongs to no one! The traps were meant to keep children out from hurting themselves in the old house!\u201d\n\nThe party tells him they are here to clean up the house, and The Sanbalet says he has no quarrel with them. After all, they are on a charitable mission to help the dwarven orphans with uh, some free trade. No one else needs to get hurt over a few barrels of rum and bolts of cloth. \u201cThe Sanbalet is very reasonable\u201d\n\nThe smugglers relax, realizing the party is not the law come down on them. They sheath their swords.\n\nThe party wants to know: where the fuck is 2 Coin?\n\n\u201cThe Sanbalet was asked to bring him, he is no kin of ours, obviously. Let\u2019s just say he was sent to ensure the safety of the cargo, and that no corners were cut on the deal. We are not exactly his biggest fans either.\u201d Sanbalet shrugs as if to say, what can you do?\n\nThe party wants to know who sent him then.\n\n\u201cThe Sanbalet only knows him from [Kreb](https://Kreb), an old friend, who assured us that the money man behind this operation wouldn\u2019t agree unless 2 Coin came along.  That\u2019s all I know, we don\u2019t know the name of our benefactor\u2026 just had to put up with his agent.\u201d\n\n\\\nThe party thanks Sanbalet for the information and bids him a due. Sanbalet bows and waves his wand, sending an impressive shower of [dancing lights](/doc/dancing-lights-MhdIhD6Vue) into the air of the cave, as the boat slowly pulls away and into the darkness\u2026.\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n",

They travel widely and are important indicators of the health of the realms in which they reside; when sunflies struggle, so do the places they inhabit. Sunflies have stingers that they use to inject natural toxins into other creatures. Planar magic can alter a sunfly's toxin so that its effect is different depending on which Outer Plane the sunfly is on.\n\nMany inhabitants of the planes have strong feelings about sunflies, viewing them as loathsome pests or adorable pets. Sunflies in Sigil are often the pets of doting, highly protective owners.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Source: [MPP p47](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#sunfly_mpp)\n\n\\\n",

Each player takes on the role of a wizard from one of ten schools of magic, and builds his band of followers. The wizard's apprentice will usually accompany his master and more than a dozen other henchmen types are available for hire, from lowly thugs to heavily armoured knights and stealthy assassins.\n\n\\\n* Frostgrave is a tactical wargame with similar rules to D&D, except you control a wizard and his hired band of thugs. You compete in various scenarios for gold & treasure, avoiding and/or attacking the other players and monsters.\n* Campaign system allows your wizard to level up, customize a stronghold, learn new spells, sustain crippling injuries, trade magic items, or hire new soldiers.\n* Frostgrave (and [Ghost Archipelago](https://geekdad.com/2017/08/side-by-side-comparison-frostgraveghost-archipelago-plus-battle-report/)/Stargrave) have lots of expansion books with optional rules, additional wizard schools, new soldiers, new spells, and different scenarios. It is meant to be a DIY game where you pick and choose what appeals to you beyond the core rules.

Campaign rule adjustments taken from the [Campaign Tweaks Document](https://trove.dungeon.church/Frostgrave/3rd%20Party%20or%20Homebrew/HOMEBREW%20Frostgrave%20Campaign%20Rule%20Changes.pdf). ==Last updated 7/27/22==\n\n\n---\n\n## Between Game Turns\n\nAfter each game, each player completes a single Out of Game turn. \n\n### Turn Sequence\n\n\n1. Roll for Treasure\n2. Roll for Injuries\n3. Optional: Cast Out of Game Spells \\[can only be done once per Out of Game turn\\]\n4. Roll and apply Base effects (EX: the Library or Laboratory)\n5. Level Up Wizard\n6. Perform Wizard and Apprentice Out of Game Actions \\[[see below](https://lore.dungeon.church/doc/frostgrave-Iyv6Nlq27x#h-actions-6)\\]\n\n   \n   1. Hire Runner for 50gp? Must be done & declared first\n   2. Wizard Out of Game Action\n   3. Apprentice Out of Game Action\n7. Optional: Cast Out of Game Spells \\[can only be chosen if not done in step 3\\]\n\n### Actions (#6)\n\nDuring the Out of Game phase, the Wizard and his Apprentice may each take one Out of Game action. This is not affected by their current injury status or any other game rule. In addition a Wizard can spend 50 gp to hire a runner before any actions are taken. The runner can do either the (a.) Oversee Improvements or (b.) Recruit Soldiers Out of Game Action. All Out of Game actions must be declared before they are resolved.\n\n#### Oversee Improvements\n\nThe spellcaster may oversee the building of a single base resource, at the cost listed in the Frostgrave rulebook. When the cost is paid the improvement can be added to the Warband\u2019s record sheet. This is the only way that base resources may be constructed\n\n#### Recruit Soldiers\n\nThe spellcaster may recruit any number of soldiers by paying their costs as per the Frostgrave rulebook. This is the only way that new soldiers may be recruited.\n\n#### Visit a Vendor\n\nChoose one of the following vendors:\n\n* Potion Vendor\n* Scroll Vendor\n* Grimoire Vendor\n* Magic Item Vendor\n* Magic Weapons/Armour Vendor\n\n  When visiting a vendor, roll 3 times on the appropriate table for that vendor. These are the only items available during this visit, and may be purchased at their listed price as per the table lists. Items are not freely available as described in the Frostgrave rulebook. A player may also sell items but they must match the type of items that the vendor sells \\[EX: A potion vendor will only buy potions, a scroll vendor will only buy scrolls, etc.\\]. Items can only be sold in this manner, and are not sold freely.\n\n#### Scour the Ruins\n\nThis action can only be chosen if a player captured zero treasure counters in the previous game, and may only be performed once per Out of Game Turn. Roll once on the treasure table and halve any gain in gold. The Wizard also gains 25 XP.\n\n#### Visit the Temple\n\nSpellcasters with Permanent Injuries may head to a temple to ask their patron god for blessed healing. They must pay 100 gold to the temple and roll a d20. On a 12+ the spellcaster\u2019s god reaches out and blesses their worshipper, which counts as if a Miraculous Cure spell was cast on them. However, on a roll of a 1, the gods are furious with the spellcaster and the permanent injury remains. Additionally, a Curse spell is immediately inflicted on the spellcaster (treat as if the casting roll were 15). This spell can be resisted but if unsuccessful, they begin the next game suffering from a Curse spell.\n\n\\\n*SOURCE: Campaign Tweaks Doc*\n\n\n---\n\n## \u201cCarrior Pigeon\u201d Base Resource\n\nThis Base Resource allows the Wizard to recruit a single soldier during the Out of Game phase without taking the Recruit Soldiers Wizard and Apprentice action. ==The cost of this Base Resource is increased to 250 gold.==\n\n\\\n*SOURCE: Campaign Tweaks Doc*\n\n\n---\n\n## Wizard Death & Injury\n\n* If a wizard receives a second **Lost Eye** injury (pg 53), re-roll.\n* If a wizard rolls 1-2 for \u201cDead\u201d, instead the wizard is **Left for Dead**\n\n### Left for Dead\n\nThe wizard is so badly injured they are thought to be dead, and their warband heads back to camp without them. Through force of will the wizard overcomes their near-fatal injuries and manages to escape and survive. The player who lost their wizard must roll on the **Permanent Injury** table and ==write a narrative of the ordeal that their wizard overcame== and ultimately left them stronger to fight another day. The wizard gains d20 X 5xp.\n\n\\\n*SOURCE: Campaign Tweaks Doc*\n\n\\\n",

This exposure mutated her physical form from human to elfmarked, derived her of both strength and wisdom, and bestowed upon her wild magic sorceress powers, of which her control is, at times, extremely tenuous.\\n\n\nKrack was taught the ways of deception and trickery by her family and their circle, and has used her abilities to augment these schemes. Rather than hide herself from the human world and it\u2019s anti magic bias, Krack has created an elaborate alias to infiltrate it by posing as a human named Jessica Jones.\\n\n\nScheming and trickery, however,\u00a0 are merely a means to survival. Krack\u2019s end game is to locate \u201c[Cirilla\u2019s Gift](/doc/cirillas-gift-pKEY4nYJDS)\u201d. Following a rumor that the artifact had\u00a0 surfaced in [New Galmaarden](/doc/new-galmaarden-03tcpxxc2t), Krack traveled to the dragon born city, only to find the search fruitless.\\n\n\nIt is while on this journey that she experiences her most devastating loss of control over magic to date; in a wild magic surge she casts a massive [fire ball](/doc/fireball-aT1QnILXxQ) on herself.  If not for the divine intervention of the Goddess [Selune](/doc/selune-wFfmk6l5Ba) through her human conduit [Math Hammerhammer](/doc/math-hammerhammer-young-dumb-and-full-of-good-intentions-UmczDtj1Da), this event would have been unsurvivable.

The streets, several stories above, twinkle with the lights of candles in windows. The area they are in is a trap of floating furniture, decayed piers, and other garbage. Perfect for crabbing, they throw their traps in.\n\nThe party discusses what they\u2019re looking for in Saltmarsh: magic items, [Math\u2019s brother](/doc/lukas-woodenkeeper-MFwbJrVzOB), and what [the Council](/doc/saltmarsh-council-8KxfpMfTQ0) is up to here.\n\n ![Crabbin'](/api/attachments.redirect?id=6dd6724e-afda-477e-b177-f50476781688)\n\n<https://soundcloud.com/kazzerax/gibbering-mouther-1>\n\nFrom the darkness below the pylons holding up The Empty Net, come [ranting and gibbering voices](/doc/gibbering-mouther-TgplvjaPZM). The party feels overcome by the words, losing it in the cacophony of voices, and Tharac suddenly dives off the boat and begins swimming away.\n\nCrocodiles emerge from the oil slicked water, and begin to swim menacingly toward the confused barbarian.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=c910ceed-f537-474e-ab80-763ba7dc1553)\n\n\\\nKrack uses [Suggestion](/doc/suggestion-pYusUQUzD5) to tell Tharac to swim back towards the boat.. but this brings the crocs chasing after him. Math is so confused he just begins punching everyone and both him and Tharac get into a bit of fisticuffs in their thrall to the painful siren of\u2026 the Gibbering Mouther. Crawling by dragging itself by it\u2019s teeth across the rotten piers slowly towards the sound of the fighting. It shoots projectiles of acid vomit as it rolls itself along.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=8509260e-cf3f-4895-8ddb-aa8bef90885c)\n\n\\\nOne of the crocs gets in the boat. Tharac is repeatedly so confused he doesn\u2019t know whether to swim, climb the pylons, or fight. Krack and Math both land blows but are both overcome - Math by the crocs, and then Krack who gets too close to the Mouther and takes a very terrible bite from a baby head that renders her unconscious.\n\nThe battle goes on for many rounds, with the party coming within one roll of [Total Party Kill](/doc/total-party-kill-pZ2LfBXNJ9) and Math\u2019s fate in particular is mercilessly spared by the dice gods. Krack loses control and goes all [Wild Magic](/doc/wild-magic-qxCCjiqddc) several times but it just results in her belching pink bubbles. She does manage to ensnare the mouther briefly with [Web](/doc/web-vW8qhEOjRB).\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=1fda7f6c-e886-4746-a0af-8cd31582cf2d)\n\n\\\nFinally, with the Mouther free and climbing into the boat, the party regains their senses enough to just barely to defeat the creature as it drags itself by it\u2019s teeth towards them. Tharac goes in with the Reckless Attack for the kill. Now covered in slime, gore, and teeth, the party is victorious and quickly downs their remaining Healing Potions.\n\nThey pull up the traps and find them heavy and full of weapons. Tharac takes a Great axe with him, and Krack pulls out a jagged dagger.\n\n# The Sea Ghost\n\nThe party rows out towards the anchored *[Sea Ghost](/doc/the-sea-ghost-lvA35qmzaA)*, south of town near the [Alchemist\u2019s House](/doc/alchemists-house-D0Oo2ziTIj). They make the [correct signals](https://lore.dungeon.church/doc/session-3-beyond-skeletons-JXWlISUDem#h-is-it-safe) with their bullseye lantern, and approach the waiting smugglers.\n\nThey meet [Bjorn](/doc/bjorn-the-pirate-CMRYdIr4Hc), who asks why they are late. Gesturing to their clothes and their general smell, they say they got held up crabbing.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=40e70902-b8b2-45dc-85be-7993aba05638 \"full-width\")\n\nThey pull up the goods to the deck of the boat. Pirate deckhands begin loading it into the cargo hold, and Bjorn invites them into the galley for a drink. In a small room with a table bolted to the floor and a smoldering fire stove nearby, they have a drink with the smugglers. \n\nAt the table is [Strezza](/doc/strezza-pvL6kQtaEA), dragonborn sailor that recognizes them from their [ill-fated journey](/doc/session-1-welcome-to-saltmarsh-IyV6iGiiKu) into Saltmarsh. He asks how they made it, and laments over Captain [Grendanna](/doc/grendanna-stormbreaker-Osm8x5hrwF) going down with the ship. The party notes they don\u2019t remember seeing Grendanna\u2019s body laid out at the wake at the [temple](/doc/saltmarsh-sailors-temple-0uvkMI2jn9).\n\nA hooded [lizardfolk](/doc/lizardfolk-a1lflONBzt) introduces himself as [Zazok](/doc/zazok-xuglPJJL1q). The party asks him what the weapons are for and he assures them, \u201cself defense\u201d for his people from \u201cthe occupiers.\u201d When pressed where that may be he just assures them \u201cmy people do not care about the human settlement\u201d and that the lizardfolk \u201clive north\u201d. Zazok\u2019s answers are guarded here in such mixed company.\n\nThey toast to the dead and Zazok\u2019s people and ask the pirates to sea the rest of the ship. Bjorn takes them down into the hold and notes that it is full of \u201cthe very best stuff\u201d from Striborg. He uncorks one with his knife and offers a taste to the party. A little drunk, he admits to Krack that this ship may or may not have formerly been in the service of the Striborg navy.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=21915b9a-eabb-4a4a-84cd-1c61165024e4)\n\nThe first mate, obviously a wizard judging by his attire, sticks his head out long enough to yell at Bjorn for drinking the cargo.\n\nThey bid the party goodbye as they re-board their boat and slip back into the harbor amidst the regular fishing traffic for the day. Along the way. seagulls poop on the party and one attempts to take Krack\u2019s wand unsuccessfully.\n\n# Back on Land\n\nNo one seems to notice that they had a shitty catch with their now empty crab traps. They see a poster on the street:\n\n> #### COUNCIL REWARDS PARTY!\n>\n> < insert very nice drawing of party >\n>\n> #### PUBLIC AUCTION THIS WEEKEND! \\[3 days from now\\]\n>\n> House recovered to be sold at benefit for annual Feast of Seven Fishes!\n\nThey take out some charcoal and deface the auction part with *MOLDY!* graffiti\n\nThey dock the boat and head back over to [The Empty Net](/doc/the-empty-net-NwapU8Z8Za) in the now waning day\u2019s light. [Kreb](/doc/kreb-shenker-ya5uvzqUn9) greets them, \u201cBack already!\u201d he takes a sack of coins from his belt and throws it down on the bar. Taking out a dwarven bottle from the very top shelf, he congratulates the party for a job well done. They inform him of the aberration living below his establishment, and he says \u201cyeah I guess that\u2019s where the guys dispose of\u2026 unwanted cargo. Makes sense.\u201d\n\nThe party demands to know the name of their benefactor, but Kreb again says that he can\u2019t say his name, but that if they come back tomorrow night, he\u2019ll probably be in the booth. The party can see the man himself then.\n\nVery tired and still covered in shit, they decide to make their way across town to the Temple of [Selune](/doc/selune-wFfmk6l5Ba).\n\n# Circle of Selune\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=a53d5f6e-8686-4386-8b3b-ecbfe6730a98 \"full-width\")\n\n[The Temple](/doc/circle-of-selune-6bp6R6Zqh6) is on the opposite side of town from the docks, and the party makes their way to it\u2019s dimly lit premises hoping for lodging. The circular building has a small tower with what appear to be many telescopes protruding from it.\n\nInside they find a halfling, and Math introduces himself with his pendant, showing him a fellow follower. \u201cWelcome brother, the mistress would be with you shortly.

The camp smolders. The party attaches a tarp to an overturned wagon cart to take shelter, and plots their next move. They warily keep watch through the night, but the goat-men attackers do not reappear. They see a drunk dwarf, completely soaked, clutching a bottle in the morning. Krack dries him out with [Prestidigitation](/doc/prestidigitation-9pvycsqJfm), and he offers off some information about the mine. First, the miners noticed that their trash and empty bottles were attracting strange vermin near the work site. But then people started disappearing. Work was shut down, and [Iron Riders](/doc/iron-riders-of-abraxas-P77pTaxjou) were sent in to deal with it, but none returned. Greyson offers the dwarf some weak beer, and he cheers the party.\n\n# The Mountain Door\n\nMore prepared this time they make their way back to the mine, and very carefully and stealthily attempt to make their way across the chasm using their new Rope of Climbing. They all make it across fine except for Math, whose armor weighs him down, and he slips and falls. In a last ditch effort he orders the rope to wrap itself around him, but this results in his slamming into the opposing rock wall like a gong. He suffers greatly.\n\nPulled to safety by his comrades, they advance very carefully into the narrow hallway before them. They manage to trigger a trap by stepping on a trigger tile in the floor, and several poisoned arrows shoot from hidden alcoves in the wall. They miss, and Greyson recovers them.\n\nDown this hallway, past bas relief carvings of dwarves working the mines to make magical weapons, they come to a natural cavern that splits off in several directions. Immediately to the south is a bloodtrail ending in a locked wooden door.\n\nThey decide to open this door and ready themselves for what\u2019s inside. But what they find are 2 bound and gagged Iron Riders - [Elior and Enryn](https://lore.dungeon.church/doc/session-5-town-business-XEOYTUfeOT#h-back-to-saltmarsh) that they had beers with back in town. They tell the party they were overcome and locked here for many days, and that their third party member is still missing. They are shocked to hear the party is not here to rescue them. Enryn says, \u201cWell fine, we don\u2019t need rescuing, we can just use the service exit\u201d as he walks down the hallway and straight into the trap. He falls down dead.\n\nGreyson gives Elior a dagger and says he will avenge his comrades.\n\nThe group decides to check out the room with the fire still smoldering. They find a large cauldron of soup containing human teeth. Around the cooking fire are hooved footprints.\n\n# Troll Closet\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=ef75bbcd-d8e3-4f6a-8406-5935c33b3034 \"left-50\")\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=94692e1a-bbb1-4629-9240-65dc8c8038b4 \"left-50\")\n\nFurther north into the caverns, they come to a large open area. They find lots of supplies and valuables piled up here. A passage further east is blocked by furniture stacked to the sealing and bags of flour.\n\nThe party continues following the blood trail until it peters out. Up a small staircase is another door\u2026. with a human\u2019s head spiked to it. Elior identifies it as his comrade, and the party suggest that maybe he should be the first to open the door to seek his vengeance. He does so and two dire wolves rush out, followed by the giant fist of a [troll](/doc/troll-F74OZre39G) that has somehow been crammed into this small room.\n\nThe party fights hard at attacking the troll, while the [dire wolves](/doc/dire-wolf-Vedxigkw0u) bite and knock them over between hits. Finally they fell the troll and get a dire wolf to succumb to it\u2019s wounds, however the other escapes. It runs down the hall and paws at a locked iron door. The door opens\u2026..\n\n\\\n",

Deep beneath the earth, I never felt the sun\u2019s warm touch on my scales. I had no name. I did not know my own color. Shackled in irons to a rock from which I could not stray more than a few feet, I was forced to mine the foul and poisonous substances the dragons needed for their sorceries. These poisons soaked into me day by day.\n\nWhile working the rock one day, I heard my pick hit something that sent a shudder up it\u2019s handle. Thinking I had found a gem, I hit it again to free it and\u2026 *a spark!* \n\nWhen you\u2019ve spent your whole life in darkness, even the tiniest fading ember feels like the sun. I hid this stone in my rags from the overseers. I would not let them take it from me.\n\nDuring each period of resting hours, I would hide behind the stone I was chained to, striking a single ember at a time, seeing what the light could show me. I first learned that I am *green*. I learned that through this stone, I could channel the poisons inside me. I could move like the shadows I had been born into. The stone sparked not just light, but magic.\n\nOne rest period, I ventured out as far as my chains would allow me. I struck a single spark into the darkness, and was astonished by what I saw. On the wall opposite my work area there were words painted in blood in Draconic\u2026\n\n### *GET FREE OR DIE TRYING!  - [RAZORBACK](/doc/razorback-the-uniter-O3oe7NBQqK)*\n\nNext to the graffiti was a dragonborn handprint. I put my hand up to it. For the first time, I knew I was not alone. There were more like me. Freedom was a possibility. \n\nThe tale of my escape from the dragon\u2019s slave pits is a long one, but empowered by the magic in my stone I became one with the shadows. I waited. I killed. I moved upwards in the tunnels, past my brethren still blinded and chained like I had once been.\n\n\\\nIn the world above under the sun, I found work with a blind old alchemist. I think he had some inkling of what I was, but he never asked, and I never told. His darkness was different than mine, but we understood each other. I worked tirelessly in his workshop, learning his secrets. My exposure to poisons in the mine made me well suited for the work, and I began to perform many experiments on myself when the old man wasn\u2019t around. When he finally passed away in his bed, I took the shop - and his name - as my own. \n\nI am Balasar, the one Haunted by Darkness, and I will not rest until I have my revenge.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=468aacc3-cbbf-4a3b-adc8-69e0aacf9b84)\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n",

Rhogar the dragonborn paladin, and Hilmita the halfling druid. With the sunlight fading, they look ahead for signs of lights or civilization, and come to what looks like an inn by the road. The sign reads: [The Gold Scale Company](/doc/gold-scale-company-m1WdlmIYwP). They enter the establishment to find a gregarious man who introduces himself as [Gregorio](/doc/gregorio-XvYkj4xTZI), the bartender, and he magically sends cold beers floating through the air into their hands. Rhogar chats up Gregorio, while Hilmita pets Big Mike the polar bear, who is rooting through the trash in the courtyard.\n\nSoon after, Krack and Math come home to find this unexpected scene and demand to know what Gregorio\u2019s doing! Gregorio quiets their protests by also sending them flying beers, and gives the dusty cash register a dramatic kick and points to the growing pile of gold inside.\n\nThey meet their new friends and talk about the festival and if the party needs help with their upcoming job.  The Gold Scale Co\u2019s reputation proceeds itself.\n\nThis is interrupted when [Manistrad Copperlocks](/doc/manistrad-copperlocks-W9uyiYutrl) bursts into the door and immediately launches into a screaming match with Krack & Math about how they fucked up their assignment and didn\u2019t do what they were hired to do!! And she hopes they are happy now, because the [Iron Riders](/doc/iron-riders-of-abraxas-P77pTaxjou) have come to sort it out and their increased presence couldn\u2019t be good for *wink wink* unlicensed taverns or *wink wink \u201c*crab trappers\u201d! She slams the door behind her.\n\nGregorio lets Krack know they have mail - and she sees the now familiar impression of [Gellan Primewater](/doc/gellan-primewater-P10FbIiWH1)\u2019s signet ring in the wax. The letter says:\n\n\\\n> Dear friends,\\n\\nI am looking forward to seeing you tomorrow for our engagement on the Dragon\u2019s Jubilee. Please board the boat by evening - don\u2019t be late!\\n\\nSincerely,\\nGellan\\n\\nP.S. Please come dressed appropriately.\n\n\\\nThe party debates what that last part means, and decides it means fancy hats. Rhogar asks Gregorio if he\u2019s encountered any good tailors in his travels. Gregorio tells him of an embroidering wizard who enchants his magnificent sewing machines with the most delicate magic, so that whatever he embroiders becomes magical itself. This sewing wizard\u2019s name is [Tiger Mistymeadow](/doc/tiger-mistymeadow-HBSOQxoi3A), and his shop is in a place only magical portals can reach called [Mechanus](/doc/mechanus-QCyEJ44miD).\n\n\\\nThe party beds down for the night (Rhogar with a very nice pillow, courtesy of Gregorio), and Krack does an [Augury](/doc/augury-CWWcf6GZTg) ritual to determine if inviting their friends along for the job is good or not. She gets the unsatisfactory answer of: *woe-and-weal*. [Krack also does a night time Downtime Activity mission.](https://lore.dungeon.church/doc/session-14-festivals-eve-VAcA8ZfizE#h-downtime-activity-krack)\n\n# The Carnival\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=5b047029-cec9-40a4-bd4f-17d871d82ac2)\n\nThe next day the party heads into town and can\u2019t help but stop at [the large carnival](/doc/revelia-hGJF8ybX3K) they see erected on the town\u2019s south commons. A large tent is surrounded by many carnival activities and merchants and the sound of music and laughing fills the morning air. They inquire at the ticket booth, with a small old man wearing a goblin costume (or is he? it\u2019s very convincing) with the name tag Nikolas. Nikolas is very excited to sell them a ticket, and as he talks with the party many monarch butterflies float around his little booth. He explains he\u2019s part of the traveling crew of the carnival. The party buys tickets and enters. Nikolas takes out his spyglass and begins searching for more potential customers.\n\n ![Saxton Pope](/api/attachments.redirect?id=66b5fd9c-1377-4f83-b263-a3b50a621bd0 \"left-50 =245x245\")\n\nOne of the first things that interests them is a fur trader from [Burle](/doc/burle-8ZuZ4qZsXt) who has set up his cart with many frames of stretched [owlbear](/doc/owlbear-kTCnClqfKW) and [dire wolf](/doc/dire-wolf-Vedxigkw0u) furs. He puffs a pipe next to a large pile of exotic leathers, and tells the party to feel free to examine his wares - straight from his own tannery at the [Burle](/doc/burle-8ZuZ4qZsXt) outpost! He - Master [Saxton Pope](/doc/saxton-pope-CJaIQ4Kkdw), Esquire - hunted them himself!\n\n\\\nMath inquires as to whether he\u2019s ever seen anything strange out in the woods and Saxton informs him that strange things in the woods is exactly the sort of thing he specializes in. When Math asks about a castle, he tells them a story about seeing red lights sometimes in the deep wood, but the position always changes. If the party wants to hire him to guide them in the [Dreadwood](/doc/dreadwood-GcfKdBzGyT) they can come by his shop in Burle. He gives them a business card.\n\nThe party then goes on to a hat merchant, of course, and everyone finds something that\u2019s weirder than what they were expecting.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=c9975f14-f4b2-4873-b2a7-1c321975e181 \"right-50\")\n\nThe party tries their hand at apple bobbing from a bored looking dwarf running what he complains is the \u201clousiest one, why can\u2019t they let me do the Hall of Mirrors?\u201d The dwarf says one of the apples is enchanted, and yawns as the party takes turns. Rhogar manages to get the magic one, and he is [polymorphed](/doc/polymorph-iBJQ6oBCEY) into a [Giant Spider](/doc/giant-spider-zh0pADNloc). Himli feeds him an apple and fashions him a leash, and they continue through the stalls. Rhogar decides to test his new spider climbing abilities, and climbs up one of the tents. In the distance, he sees a beauitful, gleaming white boat at the harbor.\n\n# The Arena\n\nThe party sees a large crowd of Iron Riders coming and going from the big top tent, and two men come out carrying their bloodied comrade who is in very poor shape. The party asks whats up and they say, \u201cOh no big deal, our friend here just lost a lot of money in the match\u201d After asking about the details the Iron Riders say \u201cWell a bunch of half-breed tricksters and a lizard might not fare any better than our brave bud here\u201d and that of course pisses them off and so the party sets into the tent to register to fight.\n\n ![Lieutenant Dan](/api/attachments.redirect?id=154b0057-1455-4c02-943b-cb4d8837813c \"left-50\")\n\nThe first battle is between Rhogar & Math while Himlita and Krack watch from the stands. They are up against two big, mean looking Iron Riders - [Lieutenant Dan](/doc/lieutenant-dan-OHzOMkhMHS) and [Fat Tony](/doc/fat-tony-8Q290Oo7Ym). Lt Dan shoots his crossbow while Fat Tony lumbers toward the other fighters. Himli enchants some stones to throw along with the rest of the rowdy crowd, and Krack subtles her own spells to cause some chaos. As blows get traded in the arena it doesn\u2019t look so good for our players, and Krack gets impatient and casts [Darkness](/doc/darkness-tYDAHpXMtw) and [Fog](/doc/fog-cloud-bpCrF9XmLE). \n\nThe whole drunk crowd rushes the field and everyone goes nuts - but not before Lieutenant Dan looks up to the crowd and makes eye contact with Krack. He saw what she did. It\u2019s chaos though, and to clear a path through the hooligans Math casts [Spirit Guardians](/doc/spirit-guardians-iF8G2DodB6), causing a cloud of spirits to appear and revolve around him and his comrades. They use the commotion to escape, but not before Rhogar sees his opportunity to lift the purse of a bookie who is getting pummeled by a drunk Rider. They make off with nearly 200 gold as they slip back to the quiet streets outside the tent.\n\n# The Dwarven Anvil\n\nThey make their way into town towards the dock district and stop by [The Dwarven Anvil](/doc/the-dwarven-anvil-1tj8fn0d9l) on main street. They call in on their favor from [Kreb](/doc/kreb-shenker-ya5uvzqUn9) to get Math\u2019s new armor fixed and the Iron Rider symbol buffed out, since it seems to be constantly inviting attention. At first the human proprietor Mallory pretends to not know what they\u2019re talking about when they mention Kreb\u2019s name, but she discreetly marks the cost to $0 on their bill. She says it will be ready in a few days, by the time the festival\u2019s over.\n\n# *The Dragon\u2019s Jubilee*\n\nThey arrive to the docks and see the most beautiful boat they\u2019ve ever seen. Gleaming white in the afternoon sun, it appears to be spotless.*The Dragon\u2019s Jubilee* is written in a neat, red script on it\u2019s bow and on the flag pole flies the colors of it\u2019s home port, [New Galmaarden](/doc/new-galmaarden-03tcpxxc2t). As they approach they can see that there is no crew working the ship - but that it appears to be enchanted and is running itself, tieing down it\u2019s sails and lowering the walkway for the visitors to board.\n\nAs the party approaches, two dragonborn in neutral toned robes stand armed guard at the entrance to this particular slip. Around their necks they wear a large silver medallion on a chain, showing the radiating rays of light of the [Silver Suns](/doc/the-silver-suns-Qtggev16EG). \u201cHail and well met!\u201d They call as the party approaches, and they ask for their names to check against the guest list. They ask the party to present openly their arcane focuses and any weapons in their posession before they board, as a sign of their good intentions. The party complies\u2026. except for Krack who hides a dagger in her boot\u2026\n\n\\n\\[the end\\]\n\n\\\n\n---\n\n\\\n#### DOWNTIME ACTIVITY - KRACK\n\n> *I love the dark. As a magical aberration growing up in human slums, the darkness was always my friend. [Darkvision](/doc/darkvision-60Q3oH8V6x) in itself is amazing, but this new Devils Sight is next fucking level. Not going to lie, magically turning off lights so only I can see and stealing everyone\u2019s shit sounds, well, fun, but I can\u2019t take that risk now, not with this job coming up, and especially not with [Lukas](/doc/lukas-woodenkeeper-MFwbJrVzOB) still mia. If I fucked up I don\u2019t think even Hammerhammer would forgive that one. Still want to play with my new gift though, recon it is! [Oweland](/doc/eda-oweland-HEslJp2L08) seems to keep to a late schedule with her [graveyard outings](/doc/session-8-secrets-in-the-crypt-Jh9ytDvK6s), and I still have no idea how she figures into the bigger picture. Alright, time for an after dark stake out at the [Oweland mansion](/doc/oweland-estate-pW6osn13sD). And if there is nothing to see, well, that Saltmarsh graveyard is just begging to be explored\u2026*\\n*-Krack*\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=5e0bb0f3-3108-49dd-860e-8c98a3105f4c \"left-50\") \n\nYou enter the humid streets of Saltmarsh from the south side of town, taking the main road past the green market which is now abuzz with workmen attempting to erect a large, circus tent with an elaborate series of ropes. A large bonfire burns nearby, flickering light illuminating a chaotic, temporary village of merchant carriages, carnival stalls, and other vendors - all shuttered for the evening. Something else new, as you come to the [Sharkfin Bridge](/doc/sharkfin-bridge-9DQ0Qs7x2p), armed Iron Riders stand at attention at either end. One nods and says, \"Evening, m'lady\" as you pass him, steadying yourself to cross the toxic aura you have come to expect.\n\n   ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=9b2376b8-4045-4715-9769-0ea04f0733c8 \"right-50\")\n\nThrough the neighborhood streets of neatly kept houses it is easy to find the [Oweland mansion](/doc/oweland-estate-pW6osn13sD) - it's overgrown yard and teetering architectural additions make it unmistakable. One window in particular is lit up brightly by candle light.. you moved closer, easily slipping through a gap in the rusty fence. You use the darkness of some bushes to approach the window, and peer inside. A long table is set for what looks like a large crowd. Candles burn, wine glasses are filled, plates steam with hot food, but there are no guests.\n\n> *I smile to myself. This is getting interesting, but risky. Family reunion with the ghosts of the dragon wars? (For that matter can ghosts even eat? Will come back to that later). I\u2019m intrigued. Time to crash this party. Let\u2019s see what happens when I turn off the lights!* Krack casts the [darkness](/doc/darkness-tYDAHpXMtw) spell on the candle.\\n-Krack\n\nKrack hears a clamor from inside, and then the timid, familiar voice of the Lady Oweland calling out \u201cOh bother! Let me get a lantern!\u201d Quiet footsteps from inside and the window bursts open.. the lady Oweland peers out into the night \u201cSo strange\u2026.\u201d she mutters, before closing the shutters and returning to the interior of the estate\u2026",

Until the day he stumbled across the aftermath of a violent skirmish on the high road and discovered two shiny things that would change his life forever: the chain mail shirt of a [dead soldier](/doc/iron-riders-of-abraxas-P77pTaxjou) and an amulet set with an iridescent stone, the likes of which he had never seen before.\n\nThe chain mail provided nothing more than a little extra protection, but as soon as he grasped the amulet, he was struck down by a vision of [Azrael, the Pathfinder](/doc/azrael-ENK1L9l9rm), emerging before him from a tear in reality itself. As he gazed on in terror, the terrible hood turned to face him and he was suddenly on a river of time, aboard some hideous canoe that seemed to writhe beneath his feet. Looking backward from whence the canoe had been traveling, he saw Saltmarsh as it once was, an ancient city filled with millions, then before that as just burgeoning settlement, surrounded on all sides by the sea, the Dreadwood, and enemies.\n\nLooking further back he saw the ruins that had once stood on that ground! There was something painfully familiar about them and he felt as though he would do anything to swim back to them... He gazed farther still and watched in awe as the decay reversed, the ruins became whole, the cataclysm that destroyed them exploded and then returned to a single point of light, and there, in all its astonishing glory, stood a towering fortress surrounded by a vibrant city and everywhere he looked he saw his people, the [Ravenfolk](/doc/ravenfolk-2FqUStq1FR)!\n\nWith tears running from his eyes, he was compelled to turn again towards the front of the boat, and as it raced towards the future he saw glimpses of himself, a broken shield, a library, a black candle, a mountain of skulls, gold coins, fire, a flash and then... nothing.\n\nHe awoke some time later, some distance from the road, but in his hand was the amulet, in his heart was a newfound devotion to Azrael, and in his mind was the burning need to reclaim what once had been his people's birthright...\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=9563b5e7-408f-4c2e-a921-43af70467455)\n\n# Sheet\n\n[KAARK_0629.pdf 3510027](/api/attachments.redirect?id=3807caf3-581a-4c0b-989d-f065e74d1ea6)\n\n\\\n",

Born into a family of esteemed engineers and inventors, Elarion displayed a natural aptitude for machinery and magic from a young age. He combined these talents to create some of the most advanced and innovative constructs in Avalon's history. His crowning achievement was the invention of the gondola lift system, a marvel of magic-infused engineering that connected the city's towers and allowed for swift, effortless transportation.\n\nThe gondola lift system became an iconic symbol of Avalon's technological prowess, embodying the harmony between arcane magic and mechanical ingenuity. Elarion dedicated his life to perfecting this system and ensuring it would serve the city for centuries to come.\n\nLater in life, he pursued a quixotic and madness-inducing experiment with binding the souls of [fallen warriors into mechanical constructs](/doc/fellforged-uX906NOf0f). He believed this would create invincible protectors, combining the strength of machinery with the intelligence and spirit of elves. However, the resulting automatons were unstable and prone to violent outbursts, driven mad by the unnatural fusion of soul and machine.",

Any shark brutal enough to rise to the top of this loose confederation of gangs never lasts in the position for long. And so the sahuagin\u2019s ultimate goal - to inflict violence on the rest of the world - is always thwarted by their own infighting and backstabbing.\n\nDespite their bloodthirst, the sharks have one taboo - necromancy. Even the bitterest of enemies will bury each other\u2019s dead on the battlefield, for fear that if not they could be raised as undead. They believe that [Proteus](/doc/proteus-Apiz4CreFn) keeps undeath locked away in the deep with his key. For the sahuagin, honor can only be obtained through death, and to bury your enemy is to honor that death. To circumvent the natural order is to rebel against god himself, who made the sahuagins the predators they are.\n\n# Crowbar Rotfin & The Black Tide\n\n[Crowbar Rotfin](/doc/crowbar-rotfin-zCYEaTtSxP), heretic wizard of the necromantic arts, believes that only through undeath can the sahuagin overcome their barbarous cycle of internal conflict.

It was successful, and his new brain unlocked arcane powers unknown to any mere shark.\n\n ![Bonehead the Apprentice](/api/attachments.redirect?id=7fb7387d-8bd6-4ff7-98a2-06d892e2cbef \"right-50\")\n\n\\\nOne day he observes [a battle between sahuagin and lizardfolk](/doc/scenario-0-attack-on-the-lighthouse-pmH3roNHEf) which goes very badly for his kinfolk. Their warband is completely wiped out. Swimming amongst the gore of his own people, Crowbar decides that instead of burying them he will remake them into something better - something like himself.\n\nOne by one, Crowbar raises his undead disciples from the fallen.

These people tend to be nomadic and independent, with an intrinsic wanderlust that led them out of the Underdark and away from their traditional culture and lifestyle underground.\n\n### Halfling Traits\n\nYour halfling character has a number of traits in common with all other halflings.\n\n***Ability Score Increase***. Your Dexterity score increases by 2.\n\n***Age***. A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century.\n\n***Alignment***. Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their old ways.\n\n***Size***. Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.\n\n***Speed***. Your base walking speed is 25 feet.\n\n***Lucky***. When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.\n\n***Brave***. You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.\n\n***Halfling Nimbleness***. You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.\n\n***Languages***. You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish. The Gnomish language isn't secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don't have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.\n\n***Stone Tea (Optional)*.** You have proficiency with your [Gnomish Tea Set](/doc/gnomish-tea-set-HrqDVlit6V). nomes and halflings who come from Underdark society know the secret of this brew, and an individual with a week\u2019s preparation time and the proper ingredients can summon enough magic to imbue a single tea ceremony ritual with [Stone Shape](/doc/stone-shape-Ni4NXltKR3). However, [Stone Tea](/doc/stone-tea-ik79CS5iIM) is known to induce erratic behavior individuals who are regularly exposed to sunlight.",

      "content": "INTRO\n\nIn\u00a0 the chaotic aftermath following the First [Dragon Emperor](/doc/dragon-empire-odzVqtQPbm)\u2019s defeat at the Doom of [Avalon](/doc/avalon-7amKaC2AMg), a new period of horror called the Age Of Mist has emerged. An upstart shadow dragon named [Nymrys](/doc/nymrys-yzr2pW19T7), reeling from heavy martial losses and [Razorback the Uniter](/doc/razorback-the-uniter-O3oe7NBQqK)\u2019s slave revolts, has shifted tactics and now strives to achieve domination of Pyora via the use of soft power. To achieve these terrifying ends, Nymrys has harnessed the malign influence of the [Domains of Dread](/doc/domains-of-dread-2Eg2DJXZRO) \u2013\u00a0 nightmare demiplanes located in the darkest corners of the Shadowfell. Relying upon their extensive knowledge of dark arcana, the would-be successor to the first dragon emperor has corrupted the barrier between realms, allowing the Domains of Dread to bleed into the Material Planes\u2026\n\n\\nTHE MISSION\n\nYour group adventures known as [The Mist Walkers](/doc/the-mist-walkers-noHrPcsZgp) were dispatched by their [Order of the Guardians](/doc/the-order-of-the-guardians-Cx68gYFHO1) contact, [Alanik Ray](/doc/alanik-ray-yo1Fec57et), to [Valachan](/doc/valachan-domain-of-the-hunter-7P9W5MpjXH), one of several domains of dread that [Nymrys](/doc/nymrys-yzr2pW19T7) has merged with the material realms. The Mist Walkers meet Alanik at his Chateau in [Striborg](/doc/striborg-mZk9jSyJUV), where during this Age of Mist, deep corruption of the city at multiple levels - political, structural, social-\u00a0 is thinly veiled beneath a pervasive yet superficial opulence.\n\n\\\nAlanik introduces the Mist Walkers to his colleague [Kabe Whippoorwill](/doc/kabe-whippoorwill-V1mW5n0Abk), apologizes for his limited time, and takes his leave to participate in an assassination attempt on an unnamed collaborator. Alanik\u2019s desk is in an uncharacteristic state of dishevelment. This affords [Balasar](/doc/balasar-xPt5OBTG0J) the opportunity to expertly steal a note off Alanik\u2019s desk which reads \u201c[Chakuna](/doc/chakuna-DvIe3aKkkM) = deep dragon?\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\\nWith a snap of his fingers, Alanik teleports from the room, leaving Kabe to explain the mission at hand. Referencing a cigar box sized illusory sarcophagus levitating half a foot off the table, Kabe explains that the characters must go to the the domain of Vallachan to retrieve a vestige located within the sarcophagus. With the warning that in the jungle domain of Vallachan \u201ceverything wants you dead\u201d, Kabe proceeds to discuss logistics. His plan involves transporting the Mist Walkers through the domain\u2019s borders, and dropping them off outside the village of [Oselo](/doc/oselo-OUZmdUmvuL). From where they can follow hunter\u2019s trails and waterways to the southwest of the mainland, at which point an island called [Kiru](/doc/kiru-ThBLg6TCvC) will be visible. Cross the water, locate the shrine, retrieve the vestige, and transport back using a mist talisman. As parting gift, Kabe offers The Mist Walkers a magical scimitar called [Abi-Teo\u2019s Machete](/doc/abi-teoss-machete-ZrSq7FcMTj) that cuts through flora like hot butter but exacts a blood price. It is taken up by the elf ranger Kiff. Kiff is also given two potions of false life to offset the cost of taking up the weapon. Kabe forms a portal, and the adventurers step through it. Nightmare visions of the Doom on Avalon ensue as the group steps out into the humid, thick jungles of Valachan.\u00a0\n\n\\nOSELO\n\nUpon entry, the party is immediately seized upon by a pack of humanoids with fangs and claws.\u00a0 Maardaar identifies the group as werepanthers before being captured along with Kiff and [Greyson](/doc/greyson-adams-0y5qoKwfDR). Only Balasar manages to escape using his expert stealth.\u00a0\n\n\\nThe three captured adventurers are hooded, gagged and rendered unconscious. Hours later they awaken in the village of Oselo where shamans and healers tend to their wounds and restore them to maximum health. They are escorted to the center of the village by one of the shamans named Khoi, where a feast and Balazar await them. They engage with Khoi, who advises them that \u201cdeep in the jungle are special trees that Chankuna grows to honor past competitors\u201d. The adventurers assess that there are two other groups attending the feast; a disheveled group of misfits, and a battle hardened crew of [dragonborn](/doc/dragonborn-Pd8mdtKo6V).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\nCHAKUNA\u00a0\n\nThe feast goes still for a moment as a woman enters. She is tall and lithe with disheveled black hair, she is flanked by four werepanthers, and a larger feline monstrosity with tentacles emerging from its shoulders (a displacer beast).\u00a0 \u201cWell, well, well!\u00a0 Look at what has washed up out of the mist! An abundant supply of flesh and tissue for my insatiable jungle! Prove your worth in the [Trial](/doc/trial-of-hearts-rules-k3F3zgA6ly). When you fail, your blood will deed the land \u2013 ensuring my people\u2019s survival\u201d. The woman introduces herself as Chakuna and welcomes them to the [Trial of Hearts](/doc/trial-of-hearts-rules-k3F3zgA6ly) -\u00a0 a cat and mouse game in which the three groups compete for survival.\n\n\\nTLACO\n\nChakuna makes her exit as Balazar notices a red dragonborn staring at him intently. He approaches him to see what\u2019s up, and the rest of the group follows. The red dragonborn introduces himself as [Tlaco](/doc/tlaco-qwUBDgjmfa) (TE-le-kow), and referencing a tattoo of a miner\u2019s pick on Balazar\u2019s face, says \u201c With all respect, brother, your face still bears the stamp of the master. We would offer to cleanse you of this foul brand.\u201d\u00a0 The two groups relocate to the dragonborn\u2019s hut, and Tlaco performs ritual scarification. Balazar is visited by the spirits of his enslaved ancestors and envisions his people\u2019s descendants born in freedom as the searing blade of Tlaco\u2019s dagger burns his cheek three times, magically replacing the tattoo with scars. The Mist Walkers and dragonborn agree to form an alliance in the upcoming trial.\n\n\\nTRIAL OF HEARTS\n\nThe next morning Chakuna\u2019s werepanthers lead the teams to the outside of Oselo where many of the village's residents have gathered to watch the trial begin. With a casual wave of her hand, Chakuna announces that the trial has begun. The characters race into the jungle. Kif utilizes his ranger skills to identify hunter\u2019s trails for them to follow. The jungle is filled with blood soaked trees and a heavy underlayer of brush making travel difficult, and there appear to be an unnaturally high number of downed and damaged trees. Balazar deviates from the path in order to inspect one of the blood trees and is immediately entangled in a vine. He struggles to escape but lacks the strength. Greyson attempts to slash the vine with his dagger but also becomes entangled. Mardar starts blasting away at the predatory trees, and Kif is able to use his impressive strength to free his trapped allies, but the prolonged effort costs them valuable time. The adventurers follow the path deeper into the jungle where they are ambushed by werepanthers and Chakuna\u2019s pet displacer beast. A bloodbath of a battle commences. Kif fires his bow at the werepanthers, Maardaar casts hex and crown of daggers on the displacer beast, Greyson lands a critical dagger strike on the displacer beast collapsing her lung while Balazar uses his artificer skills to great effect. The ambushers retreat, Balazar uses his homunculus to identify the most direct path through the jungle.\u00a0\n\n\\nCAPTURED\n\nThe Mist Walkers arrive at the banks of a stunning reservoir created from the runoff of the surrounding mountains, but Chakuna emerges with casual malevolence. Rather than kill them all outright, she offers a deal -- sacrifice the upper extremity of one of the characters to satisfy the jungle\u2019s cravings,\u00a0 and live to see another day. Maardaar is offered as tribute, since he is already physical weak as fuck and only needs one arm to cast his spells. Chakuna cleaves off his arm above the elbow with surgical precision. Chankuna retreats into the blood forest.\u00a0\n\n\\nLAKE CROSSING\n\nOn the bank of the lake are several canoes the mist walkers utilize for its crossing, but not before removing the lower half of a petrified humanoid body. The crossing is a bit of a slow go - Maardaar is dead weight, giant wasps circle the sky, and multiple headed hydra, looking for a meal, rams the canoes sending Kif overboard. Despite their bloodied state, the Mist Walkers put up a hell of a fight; the wasps drop like flies and the hydra abandons its effort in favor of an easier meal. The characters arrive at the opposing shore and regroup before continuing on the next leg of their quest\u2026",

Only when prey comes near does it rear up, its four barbed tentacles unfurling to reveal its hungry, snapping beak.\n\n***Passive Predators.*** Gricks rarely hunt. Instead, they drag their rubbery bodies to places where creatures regularly pass, lurking out of sight amid rocky rubble and debris, squeezing into burrows, holes, or crevices, climbing up to ledges, or coiling around stalactites to drop on unwary prey. A grick consumes virtually anything that moves except for other gricks. It targets the nearest prey, grabbing a fallen creature with its tentacles and dragging it off to eat alone.\n\n***Roving Ambushers.*** Gricks remain in an area until the food supply dwindles, often because sentient creatures become aware of their presence and plot alternate routes around their lairs. When prey is scarce in the Underdark, gricks venture aboveground to hunt in the wilderness, lurking in trees or on cliff-side ledges. A grick pack is often led by a single well-fed, oversized alpha around which the others congregate.\n\n***Spoils of Slaughter.*** Over time, grick lairs accumulate the cast-off possessions of intelligent prey, and expert guides know to look out for these telltale signs. Underdark explorers sometimes seal off the routes leading to and from a grick lair to starve them, then claim the wealth of the foul creatures\u2019 victims.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Homebrew\n\n**Sources:** SRD Basic Rules, page 138",

Temples of the Society act more as community centers and art studios than churches of staid worship, the primary activity of most being the organizing of spontaneous parades, theater troupes, art installations, and hosting festivals and feasts. Outside New Galmaarden, these temples often take the form of theaters, art museums, and traveling circuses.\n\nThey are also deployed by communities to apply pressure to larger guilds or interests in New Galmaarden when they act, as The Society calls it, anti-socially. These actions often take the form of celebrations or mass artistic actions, intent on breaking up the usual routines of the neighborhood to draw attention to their grievances. Being visited by The Society is seen as a serious social breach and affront to one\u2019s reputation in the city and most take it seriously. However not everyone agrees with the Society\u2019s activities or tactics, and some consider them nothing more than hooligans engaging in blackmail.\n\nThe primary funding for the temple comes from a city-wide tax on beer brewing and alcohol exports, enforced and collected by the [New City Brewing Distributors](/doc/new-city-brewing-distributors-pufN7D27wa).",

Wherever they have made their homes in the lands of Pyora, what separates them from their brethren is that they live their lives, raise families, and explore the world outside the influence of the current Prophet-King in Durandar.\\n\n>\n> Many are found in port towns, where they settled incidentally along migration routes. Others never left the sea, and pledge their lives to the hearthship of their confederates rather than follow the faithful underground. Some are outcasts or seekers - sorcerers and wizards who must search for arcane knowledge outside the unsupportive dwarven guild system.\\n\n>\n> They tend to follow dwarven customs in one way or another, mixed with the local flavor of wherever they find themselves. Just as many hold to the old prophecies as those who kneel to the new gods. These dwarves are fond of formalizing their chosen clans as businesses, settlements, communes, companies, and pirate ships - their \"hearths\" - which more often than not include non-dwarves.\\n\n>\n> Despite their independent nature and varied experiences, whatever wanderlust drives them to seek fortune and community on their own also gives them a reputation for being fiercely loyal to those they choose for friends.\n\n### Dwarf Traits\n\nYour dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.\n\n***Ability Score Increase***. Your Constitution increases by 2 and Charisma by 1\n\n***Age***. Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they're considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.\n\n***Alignment***. Most hearth dwarves are good and seek to do right by their chosen homes and clans. They lean toward chaotic, their free-spirited nature winning out over convention.\n\n***Size***. Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.\n\n***Brisk Footing*.** Your base walking speed is 30ft. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.\n\n***Tools Proficiency. ***You gain one proficiency in an artisan tool of your choice.\n\n***Darkvision***. Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\n***Internal Compass.*** *You have advantage on saving throws against becoming lost and add your proficiency bonus to any ability check related to navigation above ground.*\n\n***Dwarven Combat Training***. You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.\n\n***Stone Marcher*.** When you take the Dash action in non-magical mountainous or hilly terrain, it doesn\u2019t cost you extra movement.\n\n***Stonecunning***. Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.\n\n***Outlander\u2019s Tongue***. You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. You can speak one additional language, but not read or write it.\n\n\n---\n\n- [x] Homebrew\n\n**Source**: [GMBinder](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LO3sxJe3VceXRj56dWg)\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=8b29e32b-181a-4439-b8aa-7ff87f6d3cbc)\n\n\\\n",

In more recent generations my family became part of the [Hand of Adalind](/doc/hand-of-adalind-kFepjGY6vb). When I was old enough I was conscripted to take part in guerrilla attacks against Dwarvish settlements.\n\nI saw horrors beyond imagine that were perpetrated against my people when caught, and also horrors perpetrated in the name of justice and revenge by my members of the Hand of Adalind.\n\nWhen I was 22, My mother was killed in an explosion that happened when my parents attacked a dwarvish armory. My father sunk into a depression and became abusive and bitter. When I became 47, the age of maturity of gnomes, I decided to leave my father and his band of guerrilla fighters and I struck out on my own. On my own I was vulnerable however, and I was beaten and robbed one night by a band of thieves and I turned to stealing and selling trinkets to make ends meet. When I looked at all that I\u2019d lost I turned to shooting up lotus root to numb my pain. I was found dying in an alley, having been robbed and beaten up yet again, by a dwarf wizard. This dwarf, named Brother, taught me what I know today as a wizard. I have a complicated relationship with dwarves due to this duality of the kindness of [Brottor the Dwarf](/doc/brottor-the-wizard-g7f0cZagJh) and the oppressive treatment of my gnomish brethren at the hands of the dwarves of old.\n\nAs a guild merchant, I helped my teacher and mentor Brottor the dwarf wizard by traveling Pyora and buying rare components for his spells, potions and magical items.  He would sell these items in his shop and occasionally should he find a wealthy buyer who ordered some items, I would help to deliver these purchases around Pyora. I got to know the eccentric, informal network of wizards and merchants, comprised of every humanoid race in Pyora who shared a like minded interest in the magical arts and their trade.\n\nBrottor hinted one day at having crossed some very powerful people when he sold some magic items to a group or faction that was hated by this powerful group.  One day soon after, I arrived at Brottor\u2019s shop after a trip delivering magic items and I found the place empty, with only a note that said the following:  \n\n> Dear Rado, \\nI am innocent of the murder they accuse me of.  But unfortunately, the political powers behind this move are too powerful and I have been judged guilty and sentenced to rot in a magical laden prison cell in [Durandar](/doc/durandar-sWDxZHDVIC) for 150 years. \n\nAll his magic items were confiscated and I was left with only the small spending money I had on me, about as poor as I was when Brottor saved me. But now I had learned a great deal of wizardry from Brottor, and I promised myself that if I ever got a chance to free Brottor, who had saved me and taught me so much, I would do so.",

This rotting heap of animated vegetation looms up half again as tall as a human, tapering into a faceless \u201chead\u201d at its top.\n\n***All-Consuming Devourers.*** A shambling mound feeds on any organic material, tirelessly consuming plants as it moves and devouring animals that can\u2019t escape it. Only the shambling mounds\u2019 rarity and plodding speed prevent them from overwhelming entire ecosystems. Even so, their presence leeches natural environments of plant and animal life, and an unsettling quiet pervades the swamps and woods haunted by these ever-hungry horrors.\n\n***Unseen Hunters.*** Composed of decaying leaves, vines, roots, and other natural swamp and forest compost, shamblers can blend into their environs. Because they move slowly, they rarely attempt to pursue and catch creatures. Rather, they remain in place, sustaining themselves by absorbing nutrients from their surroundings as they wait for prey to come to them. When a creature passes near or alights upon a shambling mound, the monster comes to life, seizing and absorbing the unwary prey.\n\n***Spawned by Lightning.*** A shambling mound results from a phenomenon in which lightning or fey magic invigorates an otherwise ordinary swamp plant. As the plant is reborn into its second life, it chokes the life from plants and animals around it, mulching their corpses in a heap around its roots. Those roots eventually give up their reliance on the soil, directing the shambling mound to seek out new sources of food.\n\n***The Weed that Walks. ***The instinct that drives a shambling mound is its central root-stem, buried somewhere inside its ponderous form. The rest of a shambler consists of the rotting heap that it simultaneously accumulates and feeds on, which protects the root-stem and animates to smash and smother the life from any creature.\n\nThe dense mass of a shambling mound\u2019s body shrugs off the effects of cold and fire. Lightning reinvigorates the root-stem, strengthening the shambling mound and bolstering its consumptive drive.\n\nDespite its monstrous form, the shambling mound is a living plant that requires air and nourishment. Although it doesn\u2019t sleep the way an animal does, it can lie dormant for days on end before rising to hunt for food.\n\n***A Resurgent Menace.*** If a shambling mound faces defeat before an overwhelming foe, the root-stem can feign death, collapsing the remains of its mound. If not subsequently killed, the root-stem beds down in the shambler\u2019s remains to slowly regrow its full body, then once again sets out to consume all it can. In this way, shambling mound infestations long thought destroyed can recur time and again.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Homebrew\n\n**Sources:** [SRD Basic Rules, page 345](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#shambling%20mound_mm)",

Clever monsters keep oozes around to defend passageways or consume refuse. Likewise, an ooze can be enticed into a pit trap, where its captors feed it often enough to prevent it from coming after them. Crafty creatures place torches and flaming braziers in strategic areas to dissuade an ooze from leaving a particular tunnel or room.\n\n***Spawn of Juiblex.*** According to the Demonomicon of Iggwilv and other sources, oozes are scattered fragments or offspring of the demon lord Juiblex. Whether this is true or not, the Faceless Lord is one of the few beings that can control oozes and imbue them with a modicum of intelligence. Most of the time, oozes have no sense of tactics or self-preservation. They are direct and predictable, attacking and eating without cunning. Under the control of Juiblex, they exhibit glimmers of sentience and malevolent intent.\n\n***Ooze Nature.*** An ooze doesn\u2019t require sleep.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Homebrew\n\n**Sources:** !!Book!!, page !!number!!",

Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.\n\nWhile in mist form, the vampire can\u2019t take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature\u2019s space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can\u2019t pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.\n\n***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.\n\n***Misty Escape.*** When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling [unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious), provided that it isn\u2019t in sunlight or running water. If it can\u2019t transform, it is destroyed.\n\nWhile it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can\u2019t revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then [paralyzed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Paralyzed) until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.\n\n***Regeneration.*** The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn\u2019t in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn\u2019t function at the start of the vampire\u2019s next turn.\n\n***Spider Climb.*** The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.\n\n***Vampire Weaknesses.*** The vampire has the following flaws:\n\n*Forbiddance.* The vampire can\u2019t enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.\n\n*Harmed by Running Water.* The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.\n\n*Stake to the Heart.* If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire\u2019s heart while the vampire is [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated) in its resting place, the vampire is [paralyzed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Paralyzed) until the stake is removed.\n\n*Sunlight Hypersensitivity.* The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.\n\n### Actions\n\n***Multiattack. (Vampire Form Only).*** The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.\n\n***Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 18).\n\n***Bite. (Bat or Vampire Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is [grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Grappled) by the vampire, [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated), or [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained). *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target\u2019s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a [vampire spawn](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17044-vampire-spawn) under the vampire\u2019s control.\n\n***Charm.*** The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed) by the vampire. The [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed) target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn\u2019t under the vampire\u2019s control, it takes the vampire\u2019s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire\u2019s bite attack.\n\nEach time the vampire or the vampire\u2019s companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.\n\n***Children of the Night (1/Day).*** The vampire magically calls 2d4 [swarms of bats](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17028-swarm-of-bats) or [rats](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17032-swarm-of-rats), provided that the sun isn\u2019t up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 [wolves](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17062-wolf) instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus\n\n### Legendary Actions\n\nThe vampire can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature\u2019s turn. The vampire regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.\n\n**Move.** The vampire moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.\n\n**Unarmed Strike.** The vampire makes one unarmed strike.\n\n**Bite (Costs 2 Actions).** The vampire makes one bite attack.\n\n\n---\n\n***Dark Desires.*** Whether or not a vampire retains any memories from its former life, its emotional attachments wither as once-pure feelings become twisted by undeath. Love turns into hungry obsession, while friendship becomes bitter jealousy. In place of emotion, vampires pursue physical symbols of what they crave, so that a vampire seeking love might fixate on a young beauty. A child might become an object of fascination for a vampire obsessed with youth and potential. Others surround themselves with art, books, or sinister items such as torture devices or trophies from creatures they have killed.\n\n***Born from Death.*** Most of a vampire\u2019s victims become vampire spawn \u2014 ravenous creatures with a vampire\u2019s hunger for blood, but under the control of the vampire that created them. If a true vampire allows a spawn to draw blood from its own body, the spawn transforms into a true vampire no longer under its master\u2019s control. Few vampires are willing to relinquish their control in this manner. Vampire spawn become free-willed when their creator dies.\n\n***Chained to the Grave.*** Every vampire remains bound to its coffin, crypt, or grave site, where it must rest by day. If a vampire didn\u2019t receive a formal burial, it must lie beneath a foot of earth at the place of its transition to undeath. A vampire can move its place of burial by transporting its coffin or a significant amount of grave dirt to another location. Some vampires set up multiple resting places this way.\n\n***Undead Nature.*** Neither a vampire nor a vampire spawn requires air.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Homebrew\n\n**Sources:** SRD Basic Rules, page 352",

While sunlight shines on the spot from which it vanished, the hound must remain in the Deep Ethereal. After sunset, it returns to the Border Ethereal at the same spot, whereupon it typically sets out to find its pack or its master. The hound is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, but it can\u2019t affect or be affected by anything on the other plane. Once it is adjacent to its master or a pack mate that is on the Material Plane, a yeth hound in the Border Ethereal can return to the Material Plane as an action.\n\n***Telepathic Bond.*** While the yeth hound is on the same plane of existence as its master, it can magically convey what it senses to its master, and the two can communicate telepathically with each other.\n\n### Actions\n\n***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage, plus 14 (4d6) psychic damage if the target is [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened).\n\n***Baleful Baying***. The yeth hound bays magically. Every enemy within 300 feet of the hound that can hear it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened) until the end of the hound\u2019s next turn or until the hound is [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated). A [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened) target that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hound must use all its movement on that turn to get as far from the hound as possible, must finish the move before taking an action, and must take the most direct route, even if hazards lie that way. A target that successfully saves is immune to the baying of all yeth hounds for the next 24 hours.\n\n\n---\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=048e16d1-4d99-471e-9c51-f5fe19427e07)\n\nGranted by powerful fey to individuals who please them, yeth hounds serve evil masters like hunting dogs. Yeth hounds fly in pursuit of their prey, often waiting until it is too exhausted to fight back. Only the threat of dawn drives the pack back into hiding.\n\n***Minions of a Dark Master. ***A pack of yeth hounds can be created by powerful fey such as the Queen of Air and Darkness. Once it is brought into existence, a pack must have a master, who is often someone the creator wishes to reward. The master can telepathically communicate with its yeth hounds to give them commands from afar. If the master of a pack is killed, the hounds seek and choose a new master, typically an individual of great evil such as a vampire, a necromancer, or a hag.\n\nA yeth hound stands about 5 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs around 400 pounds. Often all that can be seen of one in the darkness is the red glow of its eyes against its night-black fur. The head of a yeth hound has a human-like face, held up by a neck more flexible than a dog\u2019s. The creature gives off an odor like smoke.\n\n***Sound of Looming Death.*** Yeth hounds make a ghastly baying sound that can be heard all around. Creatures that can see a hound when it bays are filled with supernatural fear and usually flee in terror. When a victim tries to run away, a hound delights in chasing after it and tormenting it before bringing the hunt to a close.\n\nThose that stand their ground and fight back discover that mundane weapons partially pass through the hound as if it was made of fog, but magic weapons and silvered weapons can strike true.\n\n***Foiled by Sunlight.*** Yeth hounds can\u2019t stand sunlight. A pack never willingly prolongs a hunt beyond the night hours and always seeks to return to its dark den before the first rays of dawn. No amount of coercion by a pack\u2019s master can deter this behavior. If a yeth hound is exposed to natural sunlight, it fades away, vanishing into the Ethereal Plane, from where its master can retrieve it only after the sun has set.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Homebrew\n\n**Sources:** *Volo\u2019s Guide to Monster*, page 201",

The bands of marauding Sahaugin aggressors have become more frequent, not just attacking those unfortunates who stray into their watery backchannels, but actually coming on to dry land for their violent raids.\n>\n>  \\n The lizardfolk colony, lying north of [Saltmarsh](/doc/saltmarsh-GkGI6ISio5) on a neglected bit of coastline, has seen the increasing destruction and prepared for the worst. Led by Zazok and his priest advisors, they have trained and armed themselves by acquiring weapons and magical artifacts from the smugglers in the humanoid village nearby.\n>\n>  \\n One such cache, [acquired by Zazok on a rendezvous with the smuggling ship The Sea Ghost](/doc/session-6-the-sea-ghost-xKc8xzXOU5), is held in an abandoned lighthouse near the lizardfolk lair. The lighthouse is haunted by ghouls who come out at night, and they plan to retrieve it the next day. But the sahuagin see their chance, and attack with two warbands in the night before the lizardfolk can do so\u2026\n\n# Scenario\n\n* There are 5 treasures in the lighthouse. Sahuagin capture them by draggin them into the ocean, lizardfolk by getting them within the walls of their lair.\n* Water is difficult terrain for lizardfolk but not sahuagin\n* The Lizardfolk are well equipped and start the game with 6x rolls on the Potion table and 2x on Magical Weapons\n\n# Battle Report\n\nThe sahuagin warbands make a run across the water towards the lighthouse. The Lizardfolk buff themselves with potions and send the archers up to their towers, which takes several turns to get into position.\n\nThe sahuagin Summoner attempts to summon but fails in the worst way, instead accidentally conjuring a hostile demon which immediately engages and attacks his own warband. With blood in the water, the sahaugin begin to lash out and the Summoner kills the sahuagin Witch.\n\nAt this point in the chaos, the Lizardfolk have made it out of their lair and are throwing arrows and molotovs at the sahuagin forces that are fighting over the plundered treasure. But the ghouls come out and surprise all the combatants by killing several fighters on all sides with ease.\n\nAs one of the Witch\u2019s remaining minions attempts to drag treasure away, Zazok casts mind control and reels it back in, protected by the archer and crossbowman who rain down death on most of the battlefield. \n\nThe remaining Witch forces are engaged in a desperate battle inside the tower against the other sahuagin fighters and lizardfolk. The Witch forces are completely annihilated, the Lizardfolk recapture most of their loot, and the Summoner slinks back into the deep with a few treasures, won at the cost of betraying their own kind.\n\n\\\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=de6446ec-aa87-4bc7-9ed9-2a3ca07a7197)\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=a33c2a3d-9a0c-4732-87db-ecbf83175cf2)\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=23508014-c261-43e3-b1ab-f58b84368b22)\n\n\\\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=7f0dc29c-d300-4a2f-976e-e9803eec3e92)\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=4b9907d4-9573-4819-bd5b-217177d50985)\n\n\\\n",

These dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of humanoid kingdoms. They make their homes in fetid swamps and crumbling ruins where kingdoms once stood.\n\nWith deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal openings, a black dragon\u2019s face resembles a skull. Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored near the base and darken to dead black at the tips. As a black dragon ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal appearance. A black dragon\u2019s head is marked by spikes and horns. Its tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds to the dragon\u2019s reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.\n\nWhen it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale. As it ages, its scales become thicker and duller, helping it blend in to the marshes and blasted ruins that are its home.\n\n***Brutal and Cruel.*** All chromatic dragons are evil, but black dragons stand apart for their sadistic nature. A black dragon lives to watch its prey beg for mercy, and will often offer the illusion of respite or escape before finishing off its enemies.\n\nA black dragon strikes at its weakest enemies first, ensuring a quick and brutal victory, which bolsters its ego as it terrifies its remaining foes. On the verge of defeat, a black dragon does anything it can to save itself, but it accepts death before allowing any other creature to claim mastery over it.\n\n***Foes and Servants***. Black dragons hate and fear other dragons. They spy on draconic rivals from afar, looking for opportunities to slay weaker dragons and avoid stronger ones. If a stronger dragon threatens it, a black dragon abandons its lair and seeks out new territory.\n\nEvil lizardfolk venerate and serve black dragons, raiding humanoid settlements for treasure and food to give as tribute and building crude draconic effigies along the borders of their dragon master\u2019s domain.\n\nA black dragon\u2019s malevolent influence might also cause the spontaneous creation of evil shambling mounds that seek out and slay good creatures approaching the dragon\u2019s lair.\n\nKobolds infest the lairs of many black dragons like vermin. They become as cruel as their dark masters, often torturing and weakening captives with centipede bites and scorpion stings before delivering them to sate the dragon\u2019s hunger.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Homebrew\n\n**Sources:** SRD, page 281",

The air is thick with an iridescent humidity, as if the whole wood is slick with dark magic. Every rustle of leaf and twig snapped echoes ominously in the deepening gloom, and there is a palpable sense of anticipation in the air that comes before a storm. In the distance, thunder booms.\\n\\nYou emerge into a small clearing on a bluff, overlooking the distant, twinkling lights of [Saltmarsh](/doc/saltmarsh-GkGI6ISio5) below. Blooming violet and [magenta flowers](/doc/sapphire-nightshade-Qvbjiqksvy) grow here in bunches, their scent almost overpowering with their ripeness. Looking out beyond the town, a black spire rises from the sea ominously, emanating a low green glow beneath the waves.\n>\n> \\nThe sun slips below the horizon, casting the sky in hues of dark purples and blood reds. Long shadows stretch and twist in the fading light. You are not alone here. You see something move in the shadows, stepping forward\u2026.\n\nRanger Jarfi moves through the darkness, perking their wolverine ears at the sound of someone else in the brush. He recognizes a dark form before here entering a clearing - his dueling partner, Thaddeus. He pounces, startling him in the waning light. Several other figures appear from the gloom\u2026 the blonde bard Aeff with his insufferable need for attention, Crossjack the rusty armored changeling, Thaddeus the aberrantly transformed, Kaark the hooded ravenfolk. They have all been called here for a common purpose: to pay [The Lady](/doc/lady-nightshade-3kjLNj2Zbs) whatever debt or favor they owe.\n\n> A cold breeze cuts through the clearing, a chill that seeps into your bones. \\n\\nYou hear the click-clack of horse hooves approaching. A figure emerges from the murky mist - a dark silhouette atop a skeletal horse with eyes of burning coals. The [Witch Knight Amelia](/doc/amelia-mAibH1T0Em) pulls back on the reins, slowing the horse as she unmounts and seems to float to the ground effortlessly. Her long black hair, young face, and almond eyes almost fool you to her innocence for a moment. Until you see her black armor with blood red doublet, and the glint of malice in her childlike eyes. She smiles at you menacingly.\n>\n> \\n\u201dThe [Lady Nightshade](/doc/lady-nightshade-3kjLNj2Zbs) has summoned you here tonight. Out of all the dark things that creep and crawl in the wood, she thought of you. Tonight is not only your chance to repay the Lady your debt, but to make a name for yourself and win Her favor.\u201d\\n\\nAmelia pulls a a leather bandolier packed carefully with glass vials down from her demonic horse. \\n\\n\u201dYou are tasked with a very special delivery. Something was stolen from our Lady by the humans in the [Iron Riders](/doc/iron-riders-of-abraxas-P77pTaxjou) - the patrolmen who trespass into our Wood. You will help our Lady deliver her retribution - this poison\u2026..\u201d\\n\\nShe takes a glowing glass test tube from the bandolier\u2026\\n\\n\u201d\u2026will work a dark transformation on whoever ingests or touches it. The Lady wants you to secretly infect the inner circle of the Iron Riders with it. (she giggles girlishly) You have until dawn, when my protection wanes. If not, the Knight of Day will not be so understanding if you fail our Lady.\u201d\\n\\nAny questions?\u201d\n\nJust as the last bit of twilight fades finally into darkness, Amelia disappears in a puff of red mist, floating away on the breeze, as her undead horse collapses into a pile of ordinary bones.\n\nThunder booms, it begins to rain.\n\nThe new party decides their course of action as they divvy up the interesting collection of concoctions left behind by the Knight.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2OvVeEJr7U&source%5Fve%5Fpath=MjM4NTE&feature=emb%5Ftitle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2OvVeEJr7U&source%5Fve%5Fpath=MjM4NTE&feature=emb%5Ftitle)\n\n# Town Gates\n\n> You find yourselves at the edge of a marshy field as you leave the Wood behind. The ground is uneven and treacherous, slick with rain and dotted with pools of stagnant water. A thick fog rolls in, curling around your feet and rising like ghostly tendrils. The persistent drizzle of rain bites through your clothing, soaking you to the bone.\\n\n>\n> In the distance, the low stone walls of Saltmarsh loom, barely visible through the swirling mist. Lanterns flicker in the fog, their light dancing and shifting like will-o'-the-wisps. Through the murk, you can just make out the forms of three figures patrolling the area. One rides a horse, its breath steaming in the cold night air, while the other two walk, their lanterns held high. They\u2019re getting closer\u2026.\n\nRanger calls his mount, meaning to intercept the mounted patrolmen to distract them and inquire if the gate is still open. Aeff readies their instrument, preparing to dazzle the guards with their performance and obvious talent. Maybe there\u2019s a tavern in town in need of a bards\u2019 song? Kaark pulls their hood close in the rain, hiding their feathered form.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=2c5116ba-0de0-4048-843e-de2f88d54ae6 \"right-50\")\n\nMeanwhile Crossjack transforms from knight to little old lady. As Ranger accosts the mounted rider, they call out, \u201cHail and well met! Identify yourselves on this eve!\u201d\n\nThe party sees that these are just ordinary townsfolk patrol wearing scarves of blue, not the armored knights of the Iron order. When they inquire about a tavern, the gray bearded [deputy](/doc/iron-rider-deputy-S9G0VKvtRB) introduces himself as [Lankus Kurrid](/doc/lankus-kurrid-Fp2Q3VBXoV), who bemoans the fact that [his own tavern](/doc/the-wicker-goat-695vZZb5G4) was burned to ground in \u201c[the incident](/doc/session-17-the-fate-of-saltmarsh-mBiDgChv72), but an old soldier can still be of service!\u201d He is taken in by the illusion of the old woman, and the talk of taverns, and he tells them to hurry on into the town so that the deputies can lock the gate behind them.\n\n# Saltmarsh\n\nThe party slips into town, joining the anonymous throngs of townsfolk who clutch their hoods or umbrellas close in the drizzle. There is a purpose to people\u2019s gait - as if everyone is trying to be on time for something. They pass by some building still being repaired, others bearing the marks of the fires that swept through with the fighting. They pass by [The Empty Net](/doc/the-empty-net-NwapU8Z8Za) - a surly looking bar hanging out over the water on stilts, where several sloshed sailors puke into the gutter. Aeff is intrigued, but they turn their attention to their mission.\\nThe party hears excited whispers, and leans into those surrounding them to eavesdrop\u2026\n\n> *I heard the witch got caught smuggling magic, and [the Commodore](/doc/commodore-daniel-warrington-OHzOMkhMHS) wanted it for himself. That's why he\u2019s made a spectacle of it. He doesn\u2019t like the competition\u2026.*\\n\\n\\n*A merchant claimed the Riders are levying a tax on ship\u2019s passage in and out\u2026. paying off the god damn sharks for protection is what they\u2019re doing. If we don\u2019t comply, there\u2019ll be hell to pay\u2026*\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=27ff3648-dd8b-4392-818a-e763c50dd054)\n\nWith the crowd whispering of witches, the party is not surprised to come to the main square of town and find what appears to be a gallows set up, a wooden platform flanked by heavily armed Iron Riders.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRP9mnTkgac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRP9mnTkgac)\n\nThey slip into the anxious crowd and discuss whether they should attempt to free this witch. As they do, they recognize their target: the Commodore. He approaches the platform:\n\n> In the center of the town square stands a wooden platform, illuminated by lanterns and guarded by the imposing figures of the Iron Riders, all of them glistening in their heavy armor. The Commodore\u2019s presence commands the attention of all, his armor gleaming under the wet haze, the sigil of [Abraxas](/doc/abraxas-uKXAkU30vX) proudly displayed on his chest.\n>\n> \\nWith a gesture, the Commodore raises his hand, and the crowd falls silent. His voice, clear and authoritative, cuts through the night.\\n\n>\n> \"People of Saltmarsh, you know we have gladly come to your aid at the call of your [Council](/doc/saltmarsh-council-8KxfpMfTQ0), and with our forces we have ended the unrest and brought order to the streets once again. Tonight, we go further in our service to you and also help cleanse this town of its impurities,\" he declares. \"In the name of Abraxas, the Dragon Slayer, we rid ourselves of those who consort with darkness and witchcraft. This town must be purged of its malevolent forces, and we, the Iron Riders, shall be the neutral sword of that justice.\"\\n\\nTwo armored Riders bring a tall hooded prisoner to the platform. The crowd watches with a mix of fear and morbid curiosity. \n\nCrossjack gets out their ball bearings while Thaddeus moves in closer. Ranger hangs at the back of the crowd, still mounted on Princess Sparkles. Kaark tries to gain a place he can listen in on the Commodore\u2019s voice.\n\nThe Riders bring up their prisoner: a tall, hooded figure wearing a tattered robe covered in arcane needlepoint. The Riders pull the hood from his face - and the crowd gasps, this person is well known to them - they whisper *[Keledek](/doc/keledek-the-wizard-jGCH5H0n7q)!?*\n\nInstead of putting a noose around his neck, the crowd gasps again as sahuagin emerge from the darkly lapping water behind the platform. Dripping wet in the torchlight, they are menacing figures who eye the wizard hungrily. The wizard attempts to beg and plead for his fate, but it is obvious he has been [Silenced](/doc/silence-zhClOURCrY).\n\nAt about this time, Ranger notices a large, fat Iron Rider moving briskly through the crowd, pushing townsfolk out of the way. He seems to be scanning the crowd looking for someone. At this moment, Crossjack unleashes the ball bearings and the crowd goes wild. \n\nHalf from the outrage of the execution as Keledek is dragged kicking and screaming under the ocean waves and half excitement at the mischief the party has laid here, a riot breaks out. The Iron Riders immediately fall back into formation, and they escort the Commodore away from the crowd down a side street as his thugs beat back the rioting towns people.\n\n# The Commodore\u2019s House\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=c51b84e5-34c9-462c-980f-cf5b9cb9eef8)\n\nThe players follow the Commodore at a distance, they follow him and his guard up the slick, cobbled streets to the bluff overlooking the town commons. Below, the docks are burned to almost nothing and an obvious effort to rebuild them is underway. This street though - the manors and mansions of the council members and ship owners in town - was largely untouched.\n\nThe Commodore\u2019s villa is surrounded by a stone wall, enclosing lush gardens with exotic flowers. Two Iron Riders stand at the gate, and two more at the door. The Commodore retreats to his house, and the party sees lights go on upstairs.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=8fe3f25e-4937-4f97-be4a-7988cd3c0078)\n\nThey creep forward, hiding in the mist and drizzle. Kaark decides to hide in the one shell of a house across the street, projecting his voice as the Commodore for the guards to come help. They look at each other confused. Thaddeus uses the [Oil of Immolation](/doc/potion-of-immolation-XfIWofl4UB), and Aeff aids the effort with [Pyrotechnics](/doc/pyrotechnics-KcomnNn4Vg). It appears as if a fire is burning here. Now the guards leave their post, rushing to get buckets and yelling *Fire!!!!*\n\nUnfortunately for Kaark, his ambush spot is inhabited by a [one-eyed creature](/doc/nothic-6iQFCifWqq) that spider walks down the walls gazing into his soul. Kaark feels his reality parting, the gaze splitting his soul from his mind from his body. He feels the creature root around in his brain and come up with his darkest secret: *he secretly is in love with a farmer\u2019s daughter, despite his rage at humanity.*\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=6008c904-308f-4027-b5e9-8bada0233f27)\n\nNow a fight is on as the Riders realize their buckets of water are doing nothing to the illusion. Kaark lashes out at his telepathic interlocutor, Ranger charges with their steed, Thaddeus makes a run for the guards at the door, and Crossjack efficiently begins making quick work of the Riders. Aeff strikes up a song and slits the throat of one of the guards at the door. \n\nThe house comes alive with activity and lights, but it\u2019s outward defenses are defeated. Another Rider comes out on the roof and begins firing a crossbow. Aeff and Crossjack begin ascending the stone wall, and take on the archer in a daring rooftop attack.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=eec87813-887d-4dec-bb51-5d878a74048d)\n\n# The Transformation\n\nThe party invades the house, their cover having been blown in their assault on the guards. Aeff swings down a chimney and into the bedroom where the Commodore\u2019s wife screams. He begins to play her a song, but more guards bust in her door to defend her. Aeff quickly casts [Blindness](/doc/blindnessdeafness-CplBEk4RBl) into the group.\n\nThaddeus breaks in a lower level using his aberrant form to make his hand a bony weapon, taking on Fat Tony and as he dashes up the stairs. The others burst in the front door, with Ranger riding their horse into the house and toppling Fat Tony as the others stab him mercilessly.\n\nThe Commodore, hearing the cries of his wife, barges up the grand staircase, but he is interceded by Thaddeus. Thaddeus takes out the vial of Nightshade Poison, holds in front of him as the Commodore readies his blade to bring down a brutal blow, but Thaddeus releases the vial and in an instant [Misty Steps](https://misty) away.\n\nThe potion hits the marble floor and explodes, covering the Commodore in it\u2019s foul liquid. His flesh begins to smoke, and he tumbles down the stairs to the floor. He writes and screams, his hands erupting into claws, his body twisting as his bones form into new structures. The transformation has begun.\n\nThe party, satisfied at their objective and slitting the throats of the remaining guards, begins to ransack the house. Aeff takes a large baggie of potent [Rationing Spice](/doc/rationing-spice-iguPtdfdS2) from the Commodore\u2019s body and bows to his still screaming lady, the others take weapons from their wall mounts, and Crossjack breaks into a nursery and steals a crying baby.\n\nRanger tears through the drawers of a desk and an important looking wax seal catches her eye\u2026. she finds a letter addressed to \u201cCommodore Warrington\u201d\n\n## The Letter\n\n> **From: [The Hierophant\u2019s Court](/doc/the-hierophants-court-5m7GOekloT), [First Ward](/doc/first-ward-louswJC5gu), [Striborg](/doc/striborg-mZk9jSyJUV)**\\n**Date: 14th Day of the Harvest Moon, Year of the Iron Hawk**\n>\n> \n---\n>\n> > **To Commodore Daniel Warrington:**\n> >\n> > \\\n> > In the Name of the Abraxas, Slayer of Dragons - \n> >\n> > \\\n> > It is with a heart both heavy and proud that I write to you, dear Commodore.

Each creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.\n\n***Gibbering.*** The mouther babbles incoherently while it can see any creature and isn\u2019t [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated). Each creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the mouther and can hear the gibbering must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature can\u2019t take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a d8 to determine what it does during its turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action or bonus action and uses all its movement to move in a randomly determined direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach or does nothing if it can\u2019t make such an attack.\n\n### Actions\n\n***Multiattack.*** The gibbering mouther makes one bite attack and, if it can, uses its Blinding Spittle.\n\n***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 17 (`5d6`) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone). If the target is killed by this damage, it is absorbed into the mouther.\n\n***Blinding Spittle (Recharge 5\u20136).*** The mouther spits a chemical glob at a point it can see within 15 feet of it. The glob explodes in a blinding flash of light on impact. Each creature within 5 feet of the flash must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded) until the end of the mouther\u2019s next turn.\n\n\n---\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=9452a0ad-e0f2-40c7-bad9-979e7933ed63)\n\nOf all the terrors created by foul sorcery, gibbering mouthers are among the most wicked and depraved. This creature is the composite eyes, mouths, and liquefied matter of its former victims. Tormented by the destruction of their bodies and absorption into the mouther, those victims gibber incoherently and are forced to consume everything in reach.\n\n***Amoeboid Form.*** The gibbering mouther\u2019s body is an amorphous mass of mouths and eyes that propels itself by oozing forward, fastening several mouths to the ground and pulling its bulk behind. Though it moves slowly, it swims through water, mud, and quicksand with ease.\n\n***Horrifying Cacophony. ***When a gibbering mouther senses prey, its mouths begin to murmur and chatter, each with a different voice: deep or shrill, wailing or ululating, crying out in agony or ecstasy. This cacophonous gibbering overcomes the senses of any creature that hears it, causing most to flee in terror. Others are overcome with confusion or stand paralyzed, fixated on the horrific creature as it oozes forward to consume them.\n\n***All-Consuming.*** Driven to devour any creature it can reach, a gibbering mouther flows over victims transfixed by its ranting, its multitudinous voices temporarily silenced as it gnaws and swallows living flesh. The monster liquefies stone with which it comes into contact, hindering creatures that overcome its gibbering and attempt to flee.\n\nA gibbering mouther leaves nothing of its prey behind. However, even as the last of a victim\u2019s body is consumed, its eyes and mouth boil to the surface, ready to join the chorus of tormented gibbering that welcomes the monster\u2019s next meal.\n\n- [ ] Homebrew **Sources:** [MM](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#gibbering%20mouther_mm,fbmt:sand\\~b1\\~b0,flstsource:hftt=1\\~rmbre=1\\~aatm=1\\~aitfr-isf=1\\~aitfr-thp=1\\~aitfr-dn=1\\~aitfr-fcd=1\\~awm=1\\~coa=1\\~crcotn=1\\~dod=1\\~dodk=1\\~egw=1\\~ghloe=1\\~gotsf=1\\~hat-tg=1\\~hwcs=1\\~imr=1\\~llk=1\\~lr=1\\~mabjov=1\\~mcv1sc=1\\~mcv2dc=1\\~mcv3mc=1\\~mcv4ec=1\\~mismv1=1\\~mff=1\\~mgelft=1\\~nrh-tcmc=1\\~nrh-avitw=1\\~nrh-ass=1\\~nrh-coi=1\\~nrh-tlt=1\\~nrh-awol=1\\~nrh-at=1\\~psa=1\\~psd=1\\~psi=1\\~psk=1\\~psx=1\\~psz=1\\~rtg=1\\~sads=1\\~tdcsr=1\\~ttp=1\\~vd=1\\~hfstcm=1\\~sja=1\\~lk=1\\~lrdt=1\\~tob1-2023=1,flopsource:extend,fbsr:gibbering)\n\n\\\n",

Deeply connected to their tribal settlements in the wilderness of the southwestern jungles, they embody a fusion of the primal strength of their orcish heritage with the varied traits of Pyora\u2019s diversity.\\n\\nTribeborn often inherit the physical prowess and stature of orcs, characterized by robust builds and distinct features such as prominent jaws and tusk-like teeth. Their skin tones range from deep greens to earthy browns, often marked with tribal tattoos or scars from rites of passage.\\n\\nTribeborn are deeply communal, valuing the bonds of their tribe above all. They are raised with a strong sense of loyalty and often act as protectors of their people and the wild lands they call home. Their communities are tight-knit, with traditions and customs passed down through generations.\\n\\nThey are not common in the urban cities of Pyora, preferring to live apart from broader society.\n\n# Tribeborn Traits\n\nYour tribeborn character has certain traits deriving from your tribal ancestry. \n\n#### Ability Score Increase\n\nYour Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.\n\n#### Age\n\nTribeborn mature a little faster than humans, reaching adulthood around age 14. They age noticeably faster and rarely live longer than 75 years.\n\n#### Size\n\nTribeborn are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and they range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.\n\n#### Speed\n\nYour base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\n#### Darkvision\n\nThanks to your tribal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can\u2019t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\n#### Tribal Resilience\n\nYou gain proficiency in the Survival skill.\n\n#### Relentless Endurance\n\nWhen you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can\u2019t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.\n\n#### Savage Attacks\n\nWhen you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon\u2019s damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.\n\n#### Languages\n\nYou can speak, read, and write Common and Tribal. Tribal is a harsh, grating language with hard consonants. It has no script of its own but is written in the Dwarvish script.\n\n\n---\n\n- [x] Homebrew\n\n\\\n",

Most times, a nothic is content to watch, weighing and assessing the creatures it encounters. When driven to violence, it uses its horrific gaze to rot the flesh from its enemies' bones.\n\n***Cursed Arcanists.*** Rather than gaining the godlike supremacy they crave, some wizards who devote their lives to unearthing arcane secrets are reduced to creeping, tormented monsters by a dark curse left behind by Vecna, a powerful lich who, in some worlds, has transcended his undead existence to become a god of secrets. Nothics retain no awareness of their former selves, skulking amid the shadows and haunting places rich in magical knowledge, drawn by memories and impulses they can't quite understand.\n\n***Dark Oracles.*** Nothics possess a strange magical insight that allows them to extract knowledge from other creatures. This grants them unique understanding of secret and forbidden lore, which they share for a price. A nothic covets magic items, greedily accepting such gifts from creatures that seek out its knowledge.\n\n***Lurkers in Magical Places.*** Nothics are notorious for infiltrating arcane academies and other places rich in magical learning. They are driven by the vague knowledge that there exists a method to reverse their condition. This isn't a clear sense of purpose, but rather an obsessive tug at the end of the mind. Some nothics are clever enough to realize that this is merely part of the strange lesson for their folly, a false hope to drive them to seek out more arcane secrets.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Source: [Monster Manual page 236](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#nothic_mm)\n\n\\\n",

When the hart entered the clearing, her arms held steady as she drew the crossbow bolt back. Her mouth tightened into a wry grin as she noted the gentle glow emanating from the creatures\u2019 white hide. Fey-touched, she thought with the mental equivalent of a shrug, and released the bolt. As it pierced its target, she curled her bulk up from the earth and stalked toward the now dull form on the ground. She sniffed it, nudged it with one clawed foot, then slashed across its belly with her talons to spill its guts on the forest floor. \u201cI never much liked him,\u201d rang a voice from behind, \u201cthought it a rather nasty trick his guardian of the forest act. So many doe-eyed hunters he\u2019d notched on his belt. But you\u2026now you I do like.\u201d Ramoth cracked her neck and swiveled to face the stranger. A horned youngling moved toward her, jet black hair in two braids winding and unwinding around her torso like nuzzling cats. The stranger waved the undergrowth aside with a casual flourish to clear a path. She dropped her voice to a whisper, and the birds fell silent. \u201cYou and I are going to be very good friends.\u201d\n\nSo did Ramoth meet her eventual Archfey patron, the Unseelie princess [Nerium](/doc/nerium-fGANF3SomK). Ramoth left the wood that day patronless, hauling her kill back to her village as the highborn fey sulked and rolled her eyes all the way back to the Feywild. After a band of humans seeking dragonshards breached the [Flameborn tribe](/doc/flameborn-tribe-Uj6sA3XMli)\u2019s defenses, freezing [villagers](/doc/fallowhold-uW0oE42B6F) in their beds, Ramoth turned from the keening of her people and walked to the forest. She uttered the guttural summoning words. When Nerium appeared perched in a tree above her, Ramoth yanked her down by the foot, spit on her scaled palm, and pulled her up by the hand. Nerium squealed and hugged Ramoth, then reared back to stab her in the temple with a long purple nail. Ramoth\u2019s nostrils flared a bit, then it was done; she celebrated by blasting down a tree and throwing Nerium on her ass. Ramoth now wanders Pyora seeking vengeance and safety for her people, and is known as Ramoth Flameshield.",

The few snippets he does mention are that he had a rough/difficult childhood, no family to speak of, and as a teen, was recruited by the [Striborg Marine Forces](/doc/striborg-navy-ndvIs6jZtX). Less then half the cohort survived till the end of their contract, and even fewer without permanent injury or debilitating psychological trauma. One of the other survivors in Grey's company had family in the [Saltmarsh](/doc/saltmarsh-GkGI6ISio5) area, and invited Grey to return with him, and recommended employment at [Solmar Hunting lodge](/doc/lamont-solmar-GLrWBoIX5h). Initially doing odd jobs and manual labor, Grey soon proved himself to be a competent hunter. After a couple years at Solmar, Grey left and set out on his own, spending long periods of time in the wilderness, returning to Saltmarsh to sell pelts, herbs, and other items of value, and purchase new supplies. He frequently does short stints as a laborer, hunting guide, bouncer, guard, etc., but prefers to spend most of his time alone in the wilds.\n\n# Traits\n\n### Appearance\n\nMale, 6\u20190\u201d tall, \\~190lbs, trim/fit build, grey eyes, short brown hair speckled with grey and white, tanned, weathered skin.  No beard, but rarely clean shaven, often has a few days worth of stubble.  Typically wearing well worn, repeatedly mended, but tidy and clean adventurer\u2019s clothing, a cloak, and carrying a round steel shield, war hammer, long bow, and a quiver.  Not very talkative, prefers to sit back and quietly observe.\n\n### Background: Marine \n\nYou were trained for battle on sandy beaches and rocky shores. You have launched midnight raids from swift ships whose names evoke terror in the hearts of your adversaries. The water is your second home, the rain your shelter, and the crashing waves your battle cry.\n\n### Marine Hardship\n\nLeave None Behind.\u00a0You carried an injured marine for miles to avoid capture and death.\n\n### Personality Traits\n\nI prefer to solve problems without violence, but I finish fights decisively. \n\nI enjoy being out in nature; poor weather never sours my mood.\n\n### Ideals\n\nTeamwork. Success depends on cooperation and communication. (Good)\n\n### Bonds\n\nFear leads to tyranny, and both must be eradicated.\n\n### Flaws\n\nI find civilian life difficult and struggle to say the right thing in social situations.\n\n\\\n\\\n",

As the sun sets over Saltmarsh, they see lights go on in the temple\u2019s spire and owls come and go from it, as [Deidre](/doc/deidre-of-the-moon-DfcUiaihGw) goes about her celestial business. A fox chases a rabbit across the garden\u2019s lawn.\n\nThe party meets [Greyson Adams](/doc/greyson-adams-0y5qoKwfDR) who is also bunking at the temple, a rogue who has just arrived in Saltmarsh and is looking for something to do. The party reflects on their good fortune - their previous rogue has succumbed to his [mushroom addiction](/doc/stone-tea-ik79CS5iIM) and disappeared. They agree to set out in search of bounties the next day.\n\nBefore they retire, they hear a horse and cart on the otherwise quiet street outside. Krack & Greyson take a look by propelling themselves up the wall. A lantern is lit inside the cabin of the passenger cart, but they are unable to see who is inside. The driver adjusts the horses bridle, and the party overhears a woman\u2019s voice from inside, \u201cWe sure are looking forward to the family reunion, it will be so good see uncle Thomas again after such a long absence\u2026\u201d\n\nThe driver finishes his work and the cart slowly lumbers down the main street of Saltmarsh, back into town.\n\n# Saltmarsh Business\n\nIn the morning, they see the priestess [Deidre](/doc/deidre-of-the-moon-DfcUiaihGw) praying at the altar. Math asks for more information about the stardust required for the ritual, and she tells him that through her studies of the cosmos last night, she saw a meteor land in the [Hool Marsh](/doc/hool-marsh-XaOzO7s2Pw) to the northeast. She also comments that the stars are aligned in an unprecedented way, and that if the party sees [Captain Eliander](/doc/eliander-fireborn-GSljW693Ga) or [the Lady Eda](/doc/eda-oweland-HEslJp2L08), to ask if they have any notable astronomy records in their libraries she could consult.\n\nAs the party steps out onto the street, a loud explosion erupts to the south. A plume of smoke begins to rise from the direction of [the mine](/doc/the-old-mine-ndIfgvk1B6). A man comforts his companion on the street: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s the scheduled demolition - they posted about it\u201d\n\nThe party goes into the nearby Winston\u2019s General Store, asking the proprietor what he would recommend for troll hunting. The store is empty, unlike last time, and Winston puffs on his pipe as he shows the party his wares. Tharac inquires about light armor, but Winston only has either very high end pieces, or standard issue surplus Mariner\u2019s Armor. He recommends, if heading into the marshes for trolls, using the time honored tactic of fire and oil against the beasts. He also recommends some holy water - straight from the Church of Striborg - in case they meet devils in their travels. The party is most interested in a flask that pours endless cream, but they decline to buy it for some reason.\n\nAs the party walks through town, they notice that there are an awful lot of drunk dwarf miners wandering the town. When they pass the [Wicker Goat](/doc/the-wicker-goat-695vZZb5G4), it\u2019s practically a riot of a dwarf holiday. Dwarves are splayed out in the mud, one is attempting to revive his friend by dunking him in the horse trough, and they hear cheering from inside the bar as a dwarf is hurled from an open window. The party asks what the occasion is, and a sloshed dwarf informs them the whole company has the day off.\n\n# Searching for Stardust\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=6258f1b6-5746-4cc0-8012-f7ed381e13ef)\n\nThe party decides to head north on the road, which is noticeably less well kept than the road to the south. It quickly becomes more of a rutted path, but they have no trouble on foot. As they pass the stagnant and foul waters of the Dunwood River they see that the path continues north, or they can cross through what appears to be a forest drowned and overcome by the murky waters of the marshes. They do not like the look of this wood at all, but are uncertain how to begin searching the marshes - full of pools of water, tufts of tall grass, and the occasional straggly tree scattered about the low hills and tributaries. \n\nThey continue up the road and come to a very sorry camp of [Iron Riders](/doc/iron-riders-of-abraxas-P77pTaxjou), with 3 smashed carriages laying around the area and only 1 remaining horse among the 4 young soldiers who are tending a fire from scraps of wood. They look like they haven\u2019t slept in days, and one bears his arm in a sling. Math approaches them and asks how they are doing, and the one in the sling responds \u201cGod damn fucking trolls, they come every night. I hate this assignment.\u201d\n\nThe party asks if they saw any meteors or falling stars during their night time battles, and the soldiers point to the northeast. Gaining a slight advantage by ascending a small hill, the party spots a thin plume of smoke coming from that direction.\n\nThey trudge off into the marsh and quickly get distracted by the best way to do this. As they discuss among themselves, they are ambushed by [3 Giant leaping frogs](/doc/3-giant-leaping-frogs-vDw2lrkrnB), who body slam and attempt to eat the delicious travelers. The party is victorious but not without taking a few blows and depleting their just purchased stash of potions. They pass some dying trees and see that they are covered in spider webs, filled with mementos of travelers past. They also pass a giant statue of a goat, made out of excrement. Wondering if it be the work of trolls, they examine it carefully and see humanoid-sized handprints in it\u2019s fecal surface. They keep walking toward the now visible plume of smoke in the distance.\n\n## Spiders\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=252c152d-8d55-4fc2-b82f-beff002db00a)\n\nThe party approaches the fallen meteor - a beautiful obsidian rainbow rock - that has fallen into the midst of a giant spider web. The depression left by this rock is surrounded by spider webs and difficult terrain, and some dead trees. A [spider-ish arachnid humanoid](/doc/ettercap-nWMxVJO3q5) hears their footsteps on the webs, and attempts to sneak up on the party as several giant spiders appear in the trees around this accursed place. A battle wages and the party is able to clear a path with fire close enough to the rock, where Krack uses her mage hand to scrape a bit of stardust off the rock and into a vial. Greyson launches a volley of arrows and the others concentrate their blows on the assassin arachnid. They escape the spider\u2019s clutch with their prize, and make it back to Saltmarsh before evening.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=654f953c-f478-4a5b-87bd-2f485892e624)\n\n ![Stardust](/api/attachments.redirect?id=a21616da-75e9-46d9-8fea-77090094e917)\n\n# Math\u2019s Dream\n\nThe party takes a short rest back at the temple bunk house, and cleans the marsh muck off their boots. Everyone restored, they take the vial of stardust to the Priestess Deidre, so that she may intercede with [Selune](/doc/selune-wFfmk6l5Ba) for a sign to help find Math\u2019s lost brother, [Lukas](/doc/lukas-woodenkeeper-MFwbJrVzOB).\n\nThe priestess takes the stardust and dips her owl quill pen in it, and draws the sign of the moon on Math\u2019s forehead. He falls into a [dream](/doc/dream-VFTPQqFi4Z) trance\u2026\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbyCZllj%5FJU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbyCZllj%5FJU)\n\n> A view of [Striborg](/doc/striborg-mZk9jSyJUV) from above - a series of concentric circle walls - with a singular tower rising from the center. The tower rises far above the city, into the clouds, and a figure appears at it\u2019s topmost balcony. The man throws birdseed to a flock of nightingales. \n>\n> They dive after it, down and down, in a dizzying fall - the tower elongates and the city disappears into fog.\n>\n> The figure on the tower raises his hands to the sky and it begins to rain.\n>\n> The rain washes everything away and the tower floats in a vast lake of water. The tower begins to glow like a beacon and burns away the fog, it\u2019s light is overwhelming.\n>\n> You dive beneath the surface of the water to escape it, going further into the blackness until you meet the stone of the earth. You dive into it, following a cave that seems to lead into the center of the earth itself.\n>\n> You arrive in a stone chamber, and in the total blackness under the surface of the world, a [crystal](/doc/magic-crystal-olmEylyxjb) glows softly.\n>\n> The sound of birdsong fills your ears.\n>\n> You reach out to touch the crystal, and you awake.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b4f8nafVls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b4f8nafVls)\n\n# Meeting the Man\n\nThe party readies themselves for their meeting at [The Empty Net](/doc/the-empty-net-NwapU8Z8Za) with their unknown benefactor. When they enter the bar, they find it empty except for a man in a red hat\u2026. that they recognize from the docks. He turns to them, one eye missing and scarred over, as he offers to buy them a drink. \u201cKreb, pour them something from the top shelf.\u201d [Kreb](/doc/kreb-shenker-ya5uvzqUn9) takes down a dusty bottle fashioned in the likeness of [King Olfgard](/doc/king-olfgard-wisebeard-S0YDu9xGHy) with his long beard flowing down the glass. \u201cThe finest dwarven whiskey, from the old city\u201d he says as he pours one for each person present.\n\nThe man in the red hat cheers them, downs his drink, and says, \u201cNow the real boss will see you.\u201d Kreb disappears into the back room, and red hat parts a curtain to a private booth in the corner of a bar, fashioned out of a sailboat attached to the building.\n\nInside sits a man with a quilled cap, who strikes a match to light his pipe, and takes a puff, illuminating a familiar face: [Gellan Primewater](/doc/gellan-primewater-P10FbIiWH1), from the [Saltmarsh Council](/doc/saltmarsh-council-8KxfpMfTQ0). \u201cWelcome my friends, please have a seat and a drink. You have made yourselves most useful in resolving the situation in which you created that needed to be resolved. And for that, I am very appreciative.\u201d\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=f433ef11-e695-42bd-bbbf-d0c62fe6d3ab)\n\nHe lights a candle at the table with his match, and blows it out.\n\nGellan asks what he can do for such fine upstarts new to the city, and the party mentions the old house that is up for auction. Gellan says \u201cmy financier\u201d is prepared to offer them 10,000 gold to bid on the property, but he worries that the dwarven company might have the cash to outbid them. He says the only condition, is that the party remains the \u201cclean face\u201d for the title. He rolls his eyes and says that, \u201c[Captain Retirement](/doc/eliander-fireborn-GSljW693Ga) really only requires a few small errands to be considered the hot talent among his useless conscripts, keep him happy and no one will suspect us. What happens below the house is private business that you need not concern yourself with.\u201d \n\nThe party agrees to this deal.\n\n\\\n",

When using a card to identify a monster, the user reads the words \u2018monstrum novi\u2019 on the front of the card and holds the card so that the card has a view of the monster. On the face of the card will appear the name of the monster, it\u2019s disposition, and a fact of the DM\u2019s choosing. The card then dissolves after 30 minutes, hopefully allowing time for the user to share the information with their cohorts for an advantage in battle or for record keeping.\n\n##### Gaming Set\n\n| Activity | DC |\n|----|:---:|\n| Catch a player cheating | 15 |\n| Gain insight into an opponent's personality | 15 |\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Homebrew, Source - [Dungeon Church](https://5e.dungeon.church/items.html#monster%20identification%20cards_dungeonchurch)\n\n\\\n",

Depending on whom you ask, they might condemn the ravenfolk as nomads bearing misfortune or praise them as messengers from the gods. Ravenfolk are loyal comrades and treacherous thieves, brave warriors and contemptible cowards. They are despised for their strange and secretive nature, and criticized for having no true culture - only mimicry. These contradictions conceal a greater mystery few understand or know.\\n\\nThe Ravenfolk are the ethereal wanderers and messengers of Pyora, born from the celestial drama of deities and their caprices. They emerged from the feathers of [Eve](/doc/eve-QQyGI5YbZc), the winged consort of the [Raven Queen](/doc/raven-queen-95zkXkC4gg), who, in a fit of jealousy clipped Eve's wings to keep her faithful. These feathers, cast into the nether regions of the planes, took on life and consciousness, becoming the Ravenfolk.\n>\n> \\nCast out from their home, the Ravenfolk traverse the myriad planes of existence, seeking redemption and a path back to the favor of the Raven Queen. \n\n\n:::info\nRavenfolk = \u201cKenku\u201d in the official sources or \u201cRavenfolk\u201d in the Kobold Press books\n\n:::\n\n# Ravenfolk Traits\n\nThe ravenfolk are mysterious travelers of the planes who sometimes make their rookeries high in the towers of major cities, but usually travel as solitary wanderers. They are very rarely seen and most people believe their existence to be a myth.\n\n#### Ability Score Increase\n\nYour Dexterity score increases by 2 and your Charisma score increases by 1.\n\n#### Age\n\nRavenfolk reach adulthood at 10 years old, and can live to be 110.\n\n#### Alignment\n\nRavenfolk tend toward chaos thanks to their capricious and insatiable curiosity. Greed overwhelms some ravenfolk, drawing them toward evil.\n\n#### Size\n\nRavenfolk are slighter and shorter than humans. They range from 4 feet to just shy of 6 feet tall. Your size is Small or Medium.\n\n#### Speed\n\nYour base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\n#### Sudden Attack\n\nYou have advantage on attack rolls against a surprised creature.\n\n#### Mimicry\n\nRavenfolk can mimic any sound they've heard. Make a Charisma (Deception) check against the passive Wisdom (Insight) of any listeners. Success indicates they believe the sound you created was real.\n\n#### Trickster\n\nYou have proficiency in the Deception and Stealth skills.\n\n#### Languages\n\nYou can mimic Common perfectly and 3 additional languages poorly.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=c559849d-d726-43ae-aab4-d336cb8a6dc0)\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=730f646f-034b-465b-b795-0f90ecdda19e)\n\n\n---\n\n**Source:** From Kobold Press *Midgard Heroes*\n\n[Kobold - Ravenfolk.pdf 6571677](/api/attachments.redirect?id=02711dae-2522-4f44-b241-597ca871de28)\n\n\\\n",

On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't [stunned](https://5e.dungeon.church/conditionsdiseases.html#stunned_phb). Constructs and Undead are immune to this effect.\n\n**Whispers of Compulsion.** The allip chooses up to three creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, or it takes 12 (2d8 + 3) psychic damage and must use its reaction to make a melee weapon attack against one creature of the allip's choice that the allip can see. Constructs and Undead are immune to this effect.\n\n\n---\n\nWhen a creature uncovers a secret that a powerful being has protected with a mighty curse, the result is often the creation of an allip. Secrets protected in this manner range in scope from a demon lord's true name to the hidden truths of the cosmic order. The creature acquires the secret, but the curse annihilates its body and leaves behind a spectral being composed of fragments from the victim's psyche and overwhelming psychic agony.\n\nEvery allip is wracked with a horrifying insight that torments what remains of its mind. In the presence of other creatures, an allip seeks to relieve this burden by sharing its secret. The creature can impart only a shard of the knowledge that doomed it, but that piece is enough to wrack the recipient with temporary mental anguish and violent compulsions. The survivors of an allip's attack are sometimes left with a compulsion to learn more about what spawned this monstrosity. Strange phrases echo through their minds, and weird visions occupy their dreams. The sense that some colossal truth sits just outside their recall plagues them for days, months, and sometimes years after their fateful encounter.\n\n## Insidious Lore\n\nAn allip might attempt to share its lore to escape its curse and enter the afterlife. It can transfer knowledge from its mind by guiding another creature to write down what it knows. This process takes days or possibly weeks. An allip can accomplish this task by lurking in the study or workplace of a scholar. If the allip remains hidden, its victim is gradually overcome by frantic energy. A scholar, driven by sudden insights to work night and day, produces reams of text with little memory of exactly what the documents contain. If the allip succeeds, it passes from the world\u2014and its terrible secret hides somewhere in the scholar's text, waiting to be discovered by its next victim.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Homebrew\n\n**Sources:** [MotM, page 116](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#allip_mpmm)",

The bohika (shaman) after which the weapon is named used it to wantonly cut down selva and conduct excessive ritual sacrifice to their patron. A lock of unmarred blonde hair dangles from the pommel, its significance lost to time. If the blade is held at the right angle in light, a scrawled phrase appears on the hilt: \u201c*A mi, volpal*\u201d which translates from its indigenous tongue as \u201cA blade for me.\u201d\n\nYou gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage and deals an extra 2d8 slashing damage to plants and Plant creatures.\n\nWhen you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature\u2019s heads. The creature dies if it can\u2019t survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn\u2019t have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the DM decides the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.\\n***Curse.*** Whenever you deal damage with *Abi-Teos\u2019s machete*, you take 1d6 necrotic damage as the weapon drains your blood. If you roll a 1 on an attack roll made with the weapon, the leeches carved into the handle animate and crawl down your throat\u2014infesting you with throat leeches (a disease). You must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion that can only be removed by succeeding on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw upon completing a long rest. If the saving throw fails, you gain another level of exhaustion. If a successful saving throw reduces your exhaustion level below 1, you recover from the disease.\n\n\n---\n\n- [x] Homebrew, Source - [Dungeon Church](https://5e.dungeon.church/items.html#abi-tseos's machete_dungeonchurch)\n\n\\\n",

They observe two main entrances, with working ants carrying in various objects down into the depths below. After some strategizing, praying, and spell preparation they decide to make their way out as tiny little people and see if they can skirt around the ant hill and check out the (giant, to them) door at the other end.\n\nThey attempt to be stealthy, but the ants mostly ignore them as they go about their business. About halfway across the room, they see one of the smoldering [coal ants](/doc/giant-coal-ant-M9repJEaQW) come wandering from the direction of the portal. As it approaches the ant hill, it is viciously attacked and dismembered by the other ants. The players see the guards checking everyone by apparently smelling them as they enter.\n\nThey continue to the door, which Ramoth [spider climbs](/doc/spider-climb-H6nEMZuLZV) up with a rope. She peers through the key hole, but sees only darkness through the portal that only maybe the gnome could fit through. Rado assists with a [dancing light](/doc/dancing-lights-MhdIhD6Vue), but all they see is more machinery and a workshop in the room beyond.\n\n> As you approach the massive mound that serves as the entrance to the ant hill dungeon, a patrol of large, armored ants emerges from a nearby tunnel. The ants move with purpose, their antennae twitching and sweeping the air around them. You notice that they seem to be reacting to your presence, even though you haven't made a sound. The air is thick with the earthy scent of the nest, but there's something more\u2014a sharp, unfamiliar acidic smell riding on a warm breeze that you realize is getting stronger the closer you get to the entrance\u2026\n\nTurning their attention back to the ant hill, they approach one of the entrances and attempt to talk to the ants lined up there, all of them appear to be carrying random items into the hive. The party finds them to be simple creatures who can barely form sentences. Ama uses [Animal Friendship](/doc/animal-friendship-0TKhqsm2ye) to talk to one, and they do a little dance together which the others join in on, getting that ant musk all over them. Like the other ants, they all pull something out of the packs (an iron pot, a flask, a gear, a hammer, and a crossbow) and get in line like they belong there.\n\nThe party attempts to slip through the door one by one, and only runs into a minor extra inspection as the last of them make it through.\n\n## Worker Barracks\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=5aa56f5d-a8ab-413e-896e-31dee44bd8f0)\n\nThey arrive in a large worker barracks, where ants scurry busy on at their work, ignoring the party. High up above, various honeypot ants hang from the ceiling, dripping drops of sticky nutrition that the ants stop to slurp up. The party also observes several translucent-skinned little bug babies climbing up the walls with mischievous grins. The party decides to ignore them, despite wondering why they are, and hopes they leave them alone. They try to blend in with the crowd, again getting in the line of ants and going with the flow, towards a passage leading deeper, downwards into the hive.\n\nHowever one of the [fey mites](/doc/mite-pRblyvMyf7) laughs in a manner that unnerves Ama, and it pulls out a knife and cuts the anchor of one of the honeypots. It smashes down on Ama, knocking her prone and covering her in delicious sticky goo. The ants begin to make a scene but the party slips through them best they can, lowering a rope and descending into the next level\u2026.\n\n## Larva Nursery\n\nThey rappel themselves down the smooth shaft to where they find a nursery, with several buzzing [witchlights](/doc/witchlight-sbRt4HC9Ey) providing warm light to the room\u2019s floor that teems with baby ant larvae. Several nursery workers appear to be feeding the babies, picking them up one by one and giving them drops from a bottle. Lots of glowing mushrooms begin to grow here, and get thicker the further down the tunnel past the nursery. Ants are streaming past them in their line, carrying their weird offerings further into the ant hill.\n\nThe party observes the nursery and sees again the mite creatures causing some mischief. They look at the ant egg they took that\u2019s in the [Bag of Holding](/doc/bag-of-holding-vaqJdkPRX2) and debate whether to return it or not, but think maybe they better not mention it now that they\u2019re surrounded underground. They stop here and debate what to do next, and Ama produces the [Ley Line Lens](/doc/ley-line-lens-A8oN3yTn4x). She sees again the ley line being bent by magical influence, but it clearly leads down the passage deeper into the ant\u2019s domain.\n\n## Fun Guys\n\nAs they go deeper, the atmosphere gets more humid. What were smooth adobe tunnels turn muddy, lined with mushrooms of all kinds, some gently lighting the path ahead. The ants pass in a line above the party, upside down on the ceiling.\n\nRado again casts his dancing lights ahead, and the party finds a prefect faerie circle of mushrooms. As they approach, one of them is inadvertently stepped on and [it shrieks](/doc/shrieker-TRgiVx3wOm) out in the most annoying manner possible. Greyson sinks his blade into it, and comes out [covered in spores.](/doc/sporebane-7Fte9HtwL6) The party begins to attract the attention of the ants, but it eventually quiets down. Ama pokes in the middle of the circle, and the floor falls out. A stench of rot comes up from the dark tunnel below. The party decides to traverse this as carefully as possible - without upsetting the [shriekers](/doc/shrieker-TRgiVx3wOm) - and they manage to do so.\n\n## The Queen :princess:\n\nThe party enters in a huge, well lit cavern with a [big fat queen](/doc/giant-ant-queen-DFmrJM0oNu) ant holding court, guarded by armored soldier ants. The party watches as the ants in line each approach her majesty with an offering, and the queen either is disgusted and throws it in a rather large pile of trash trinkets, or in a pile of gleaming gold and magic items. The party whispers among themselves and begins to strategize\u2026 what magic items can they part with? Quickly it is their turn, and they are thrust before Her Majesty. They offer up a spell scroll and one of the elven trinkets they found in the ruins, and the Queen is delighted. She admonishes the workers for not bringing her treasures such as this. The party steps forward and asks, do you know the way to the dragonborn rebels?\n\nThe Queen obliges, and sends two of her armored soldiers to lead the party down a pipe, back to the outside world\u2026\n\n# The Rebel Hide Out\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=485d3eb3-ab68-464f-9c0c-35a61ff3c396)\n\n> The room is a hive of activity, filled with dragonborn soldiers of various hues, their scales gleaming in the dim light. They huddle in small groups, sharpening weapons, mending armor, and preparing supplies for the next assault. The atmosphere is tense but resolute.\n>\n> Dominating one wall is a large black flag, tattered at the edges. \n>\n> Crude wooden tables assembled out of the dbris are strewn with maps, blueprints, and scattered weapons. A few dragonborn are gathered around one such table, deep in strategic discussion, pointing at various locations and animatedly debating their next moves. Others tend to the wounded, applying bandages and offering words of encouragement.\n>\n> In one corner, a makeshift forge glows with a fiery intensity, the clang of hammer on metal ringing out as weapons are hastily repaired and crafted. \\n\\nTwo dragonborn with an air of authority stand at a table in the center of it all, arguing over a large map\u2026\n\nThe party approaches the dragonborn and introduces themselves. They explain that they have traveled through time and carried an important message from the Elves of [Avalon](/doc/avalon-7amKaC2AMg) via [Leshanna Starwhisper](/doc/leshanna-starwhisper-hyyvxrFCai): they must deliver the [Collector of Souls](/doc/collector-of-souls-XA0hpJ7gfE) to the [dragonborn](/doc/dragonborn-pyoran-Pd8mdtKo6V) known as [Razorback](/doc/razorback-the-uniter-O3oe7NBQqK).\n\nAstonished, the green dragonborn with the scarred face steps forward.\n\n ![Razorback](/api/attachments.redirect?id=890c9570-680f-4c1a-9042-cf2e3170b188)\u201cI don\u2019t believe in prophecy but I do believe in fate\u201d he says as he takes it from Ama\u2019s hands very carefully. \u201cI am [Razorback](/doc/razorback-the-uniter-O3oe7NBQqK), the leader of these rebel forces. You have come just in time.\u201d\n\n\u201cEach soul bound within the [Collector of Souls](/doc/collector-of-souls-XA0hpJ7gfE) carries a story of pain and resilience. They are the spirits of my kin, enslaved and broken by the [Dragon Empire](/doc/dragon-empire-odzVqtQPbm), yet they still possess the strength to fight. Their sacrifice will not be in vain\u2026..\u201d\n\nThe other dragonborn, a red woman with an imposing presence takes the artifact from Razorback with an aura of reverence.\n\nRamoth asks what they can do, and Razorback says he needs their help seizing an Imperial War Machine in the morning. It will be returning from it\u2019s patrol route, and they want to seize it so they can take over a weapons depot. But until the party showed up, they had no way to power the war machine, which feeds on souls. Using the Collector, the incinerator can be bypassed to fuel the machine. The party agrees to help, and Razorback\u2019s Lieutenant speaks up\u2026\n\n ![Vayra Flamescale, Lieutenant](/api/attachments.redirect?id=ba6c33e0-a116-4fc5-a017-475d54855620 \"right-50\")\n\n\u201cI am [Vayra Flamescale](/doc/vayra-flamescale-vwqZH6BvcX), and I am leading the mission tomorrow. Once we have the power of the machine, there will be enough magic to tap into to send you back home. Help us and I swear I will see you through it safely.\u201d\n\nRamoth speaks up now - \u201cThese are my people, we will help\u201d\n\nRazorback says, \u201cSeeing you here gives us hope, because I know now it truly is possible what we fight for. Maybe it is prophecy..\u201d\n\nVayra stands up on the table, holding up the great gem of the Collector of Souls for all to see.\n\n> \u201cI have fought alongside many, but none have shown the bravery and determination that I see in all of you today\u2026.\\nRazorback\u2019s dream is our future, and I will fight to my last breath to see it realized. Indeed, we carry those who with us who have already made the ultimate sacrifice, and yet their spirits still fight and fuel this revolution! We will do no less.\\nStay sharp and trust in each other. The Empire\u2019s strength lies in its numbers, but our strength lies in our unity and resolve. No one can save us but us!\u201d\n\nThe camp cheers, and the soldiers slowly break away to their tents, anxious for what happens tomorrow.\n\n# War Machine\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=2e1d1717-5b9c-49ad-8b44-e309e1766990)The party sets in ambush of [the war machine](/doc/warlock-8vMFK7Q7VK) pre-dawn behind the ruins of a bombed out building, while the other group waits a little further down the road. Soon, the rumbling machine comes around the bend in the road nearest the party. They take cover, and Ramoth boldly strides out towards the dargonborn who cling to the side of the gear War Machine, bored looking sitting at the great crossbow turrets. They dejectedly make efforts at calling out and threatening her, but once they see she is a dragonborn they tell her to catch a ride. She pulls up onto the rumbling engine and hangs on, chatting up the other dragonborn alongside her. \u201cOh yeah I\u2019m an Officer of the Whatever Division\u201d and he buys it. Soon Bahruhn has approached from the back, and Rado and Greyson are closing the distance undetected, their spells and attacks ready. All at once, the party throws the first blow and attacks the crew, wrestling control of the machine and it\u2019s crossbow stations before the unarmored mages can stop them. \n\nGreyson takes over the driver\u2019s seat as the fight rages on, steering the great machine with it\u2019s meat grinder fore end towards more approaching enemy Imperial troops. The meat grinder cuts through both flesh and trees, sending magical items flying through the blood soaked air. With the players taking the upper hand in the fight, the other rebels coming running in.\n\nVayra leaps onto the war machine and runs to where Greyson is at the helm. The engine sputters and stalls, but Vayra plugs in the Collector of Souls into it\u2019s console. The machine gasps to life, energized at a new speed. Greyson turns it\u2019s awful weapon towards the weapons depot down the road. He plunges into the building as Imperial troops shoot helplessly at it\u2019s armored facade. The weapons depot collapses around the enemy and Greyson finally hits the brakes.\n\n# [The Doom of Avalon](/doc/the-doom-of-avalon-wVeAiTDpDF)\n\nAs the party takes in the scene, in the distance they see the great central crystal tower of [Avalon](/doc/avalon-7amKaC2AMg) being attacked by the great black dragon of the [Emperor](/doc/dragon-empire-odzVqtQPbm) himself. As the dragon goes in for a direct fire breath attack on the tower, it explodes in a giant mushroom cloud of magical energy, [a wave of destruction emanating outwards](/doc/the-doom-of-avalon-wVeAiTDpDF).\n\nVayra pulls the Greyson off the controls - \u201cNOW IS THE TIME!\u201d as she makes arcane movements with her finger, a portal erupts in front of her. *\u201cThe prophecy is finished, this fight is no longer yours. Go while you still can!\u201d*",

The clinking of chains echoes through this cursed place, twinkling like an infernal melody in the murky darkness. Candles burn a sooty light that casts a web of shadows on the walls.\\n\\nFrom the far side of the altar a voice pierces the silence, echoing with a chilly resonance : \n>\n> \\n**Esteemed interlopers, I bow before your power! I beseech your uncorrupted souls to unshackle my bonds the way you have unshackled my torturer\u2019s head from his body.\u201d**\\n\\nHis eyes peer out from behind the altar, glowing with red fire. He laughs the laugh of a child, his echoing with the clinking of the swaying chains.\\n\\n**Grant me that sweet libation of freedom, and I shall show you their inner sanctum\u2026.\u201d**\n\nZargnaw attempts to bargain with them: kill [Eldan](/doc/eldan-fletcher-QWyA10eG7I), and he\u2019ll open the guild\u2019s inner sanctum to them. He looks at the hearts on the altar longingly, \u201cThey did that to me\u2026\u201d. He spider climbs the wall and uses his clawed finger to draw the outline of a door in burning red magic, revealing a heavy metal door bolted and locked into the rock. \n\nThe party hears the celebration upstairs still going on, now very late into the night. They stand in this terrible cavern, with the hearts still pumping blood on the altar. Grey skewers one on his sword, as the others debate their next move. They are unsure whether to trust the Iron Riders, or [Zargnaw](/doc/zargnaw-gZYDM82FXz), and think they should try to escape without being seen.\n\nThey decide to swim back up the well since they all need a bath and a good rest.\n\nUnfortunately when they surface, dozens of guildsmen and [Iron Riders](/doc/iron-riders-of-abraxas-P77pTaxjou) are in the courtyard around a great bonfire. \u201cAh there they are you cheeky bastards, swimming in the well!\u201d Several hands reach to draw them up and out of it, dripping wet, and drinks are put in their hands. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave yet - the best part of our tradition is just about to happen!\u201d\n\nThe party looks around for anyone they know and see [Saxton](/doc/saxton-pope-CJaIQ4Kkdw) & [Commodore Warrington](/doc/commodore-daniel-warrington-OHzOMkhMHS) sees both sitting on a dias, at two chairs, with an empty throne in between them. They also notice that everyone here is very heavily armed, and an anticipatory menace permeates the crowd.\n\n# The Hunting Party\n\nAs the first hint of civil twilight, with the darkest part of the night past, everyone looks to the wrought iron gate of the guildhall being opened by torchbearers, and a young woman in a flowing red dress rides in atop a skeletal horse. Greyson mutters under his breath, *\u201dAmelia!\u201d*\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=2a7038c0-171a-47d3-9856-2d10f058c983)She dismounts the undead beast and is escorted by guildsmen to the platform. She takes her place between Saxton and Warrington, who fill a wine glass for her. The party feels the guildsmen surround them, slowing pushing them up towards the front of the crowd. Amelia, rising and raising her glass to the crowd, which has now gone quiet, she says:\n\n> Loyal servants of the [Lady of the Wood](/doc/lady-nightshade-3kjLNj2Zbs) and valiant warriors of the Iron Riders, I am honored to see you off this morning. Together, as comrades, we embark on a hunt like no other\u2014a pursuit that shall test the mettle of all who attempt it and prove the unwavering strength of our alliance. May the darkness guide your steps and the thrill of the chase invigorate your spirits.\\n\\nHer gaze then turns to the party, her expression a mix of amusement and dark promise.\\n\\n\"And to our esteemed guests, the choices before you are as stark as the night is long. Join us in our noble endeavor, mark your allegiance by signing your names in the ancient ledger, and hunt those who have been marked by fate. Embrace the honor of the hunter, and enjoy the spoils and protections that come with those who prove their devotion to our Queen\u2026\n\nTwo Iron Riders - [Mara](/doc/mara-dADMrr538D) and [Erik](/doc/erik-jorgansen-cfriEl7OGK) - drag a bound and chained [Cerric Shadowleaf](/doc/cerric-shadowleaf-jMvCl3ogF1), who appears furious and curses and kicks at his captors. They throw him to the ground in front of Amelia, drawing their swords as they stand over him.\n\nAmelia calls out, \u201c[Iron Thrax](/doc/iron-thrax-XjradLKM25)! You wish to gain the favor of our Lady?\u201d\n\nIron Thrax is similarly thrust out to the front beside the party. He seems flummoxed, looking horrified at Cerric in front of him. \u201cMistress, this hunt\u2026. my own family was killed by butchers\u2026\u201d\n\nAmelia responds: \u201cDid you not tell me you would do anything to avenge them? Pay any price, even your soul? Today I name my price: Make your choice to be a hunter, or join the hunted.\u201d\n\nIron Thrax responds dejectedly, \u201cI will hunt\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as you my Lady bound me to her, I bind thee to me.\u201d She places a golden brooch with the symbol of the guild around his shoulders, similar to the one that Saxton wears. \n\nAmelia asks the party the same question. Grey lunges out at her with a reckless attack, but Amelia waves her hand in a bored manner at him and he [freezes in time](/doc/time-stop-u5l0EnWL4r), suspended in the air as he jumps with weapon in hand. The party refuses.\n\nAs the sunlight finally cracks the horizon, Amelia says: \u201cMy time here is coming to an end, in my absence the Knight of Day will watch over the proceedings.\u201d\n\nAs she says this, everyone smells the distinct smell of burning flesh on the wind.\n\nAmelia snaps her fingers and turns into a mist.\n\nThe hunt begins. A [horn](/doc/guildmasters-hunting-horn-PkmJIssiGT) is blown.\n\n# The Hunt\n\nThe crowd cheers and the gates of the guildhall are thrown open. Greyson uses his magic ring to create a poof of mist around the party as a diversion. Guildsmen bring out packs of dogs and ready their weapons as they laugh. Cerric shouts, *\u201dRUN!!!!!\u201d* and the party sprints. The dogs are unleashed, and Greyson trips, going down. Ama and Rado alternate [Wall of Thorns](/doc/wall-of-thorns-wEDoOfhshp) and sticky spider [Webs](/doc/web-vW8qhEOjRB) to hold their pursuers back and are successful. They gain the party a good lead, as they burst out of the town gates and run into the woods with the dogs baying fading into the distance.\n\nThey first attempt to create a diversion, taking the stinking dragon\u2019s head out of their bag of holding. Bahruhn runs it up a tree, smearing viscera and bad smells everywhere. Cerric tells them he knows there is an elven ruin they could take refuge in, but without the powers of the guild he doesn\u2019t know how to navigate to it. They push through some minor forest inconveniences.\n\n## The Briar Patch\n\nThe game trail they\u2019re following ends abruptly at a large patch of blackberry briars, sharp thorns glistening with dew and berries so ripe you can smell the fermentation. Rado uses his [Detect Magic](/doc/detect-magic-eyp2IwEbpj) to see if he can get a better idea of which way to go, and finds they are near an illusion of some sort. He reaches out to touch the briars, and as he nears them the vines pull back with quick, snake-like motions\u2026 revealing a path.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=3dd2da37-b899-46e8-a026-4c53d761c67a)The party doesn\u2019t feel good about this, but they follow the path. It closes up behind them, but continues to reveal itself as they walk through the briars. Around them, they hear a distinct clicking noises coming from multiple directions. Ama thinks they might be finches.\n\nJust as they feared, it was a trap. Suddenly several [briar children](/doc/child-of-the-briar-sI5pUsj9VA) pop up out of the berry laden bushes and the vines rush out to entangle the party. They get everyone except Grey, who kicks at one of the little stick people as it stabs him in the ankle with a thorny trident.\n\nA briar child wearing a crown and smoking a corncob pipe with the pungent smell of [dreamvine](/doc/dream-vine-viEBw5FxT7). He blows smoke rings at the party. \u201cWell well well what do we have here? A whole party, what do you know. It\u2019s time to pay the toll folks! Give me something shiny\u201d he says greedily.\n\nThe other briar children laugh, until Grey threatens fire. They get very agitated, \u201cNone of that big man!!! Just give us what we want!!\u201d as the party hears the baying hounds getting closer.\n\nAfter some bargaining back and forth, the party establishes a rapport with the bandits and give up a few precious stones and pieces of gold and platinum. Now much nicer, the briar king introduces himself as [King Thistletongu](/doc/king-thistletongue-glZXlT4FaG)e and what he really wants is a shiny whistle.\n\nHaving bought off his good will, the briar children mischievously promise to delay the hunters.\n\n## Burning Meadow\n\nThe party continues on there way and comes to a meadow, still smoldering as if from a wildfire. In the center of the field is a single blackened oak tree, with a charred deer carcass hanging from a chain. Beneath the dead animal is it\u2019s heart, slowly beating black blood\u2026 a burning trail leads away into the woods.\n\nThe party thinks back to the burning gulthias tree in the [Sunless Temple](/doc/sunless-temple-yS5i3gqWiO), and wonder - who is the Knight of Day? Rado thinks this place feels void of life and magic.\n\nSeveral nightingales come and sing over the corpse of the deer, as if in eulogy.\n\n## Ambush\n\nThe party continues and comes to a shallow stream, about 15 feet across. They skip across the rocks (or Ama walks, magically) and examine a much weathered statue of obvious elven origin. Cerric comments that they must be on the right track. Then they hear a rustling in the bushes\u2026 and out comes an Owlbear, pissed off. Grey begins to whack at it with his sword.\n\nAt this moment, the hounds finally catch up catching the party split across opposite sides of the stream. The baying of the [spellhounds](/doc/spellhound-P8vzvEmuaZ) causes Rado\u2019s magic to misfire, it\u2019s droning resonance getting into his head. Taking hits from both sides, the guildsmen arrive after their hounds - Eldan, Iron Thrax, and Saxton all engaging with their greatswords and firing crossbow bolts at the party. Bahruhn takes several successful runs at the Owlbear, then Ama casts [Shatter](/doc/shatter-yjdXR6DPdg) and the Owlbear\u2019s head explodes in a brief moment of victory. Bahruhn returns to the frey on the other side of the stream only to be struck down by Commodore Dan. Greyson gets in a bunch of good stabs and evasions, and finally Eldan goes down as well. The guildsmen surround their injured comrade and begin to pull him back into the brush, making a retreat as they hold up shields and ready their crossbows menacingly at the party. Grey makes a final rush at them, dodging their crossbow bolts as they leave behind the party in not much better shape than their attackers.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=4a46a55c-70b2-4d63-b142-0b206e2b7cd0) ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=52567112-ddc3-4fa5-914d-58255a816132)\n\n\n---\n\n- [x] Homebrew added: [King Thistletongue](/doc/king-thistletongue-byqTEswqZE)\n\n\\\n",

If the mite is hidden, using this ability does not reveal its location. While the creature is affected by this hex, whenever it makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, it must roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from the d20 roll. On any turn in which it suffers the effect of the hex, the target can attack an ally as a reaction, ignoring the effect of the hex when it does so. It can then ignore the effect of the hex until the end of its turn.\n\n## Mite\n\nMites are vexing fey creatures that delight in causing minor havoc and playing irritating pranks, making even the coolest, most experienced adventurers prone to outbursts of destructive frustration. When mites are about, even the simplest task can turn into a disaster, and a mild disagreement can quickly become a brawl.\n\n***Heralds of Frustration.*** Mites are natives of the Feywild that arise when a creature becomes so irritated with a situation or event that it lashes out in violence. That creature experiences strange dreams the next time it sleeps, then sleepwalks to the nearest tree or other large plant, digs a small hole, screams into the depression, and refills the hole. When it awakes the next morning, the creature feels strangely refreshed. Then on the night of the next new moon, the dug-up earth stirs and a pack of mites emerges. Born of frustration and anger, these creatures exist only to replicate in others the emotions that created them.\n\n***Nettlesome Pranksters.*** Mites prefer to live underground, seeking out dungeons and cave warrens where they dig a network of hidden burrows that wrap around existing passages and chambers. They use these hiding spots to watch the comings and goings of monsters and adventurers, setting traps to vex and annoy whenever possible. A trip wire might be set at the top of a flight of stairs to send creatures crashing down. Locks might be jammed with debris, gems replaced with fakes, and prized treasures stolen away. Mites aim to kill only if threatened with direct violence, content to otherwise take joy in watching mundane or simple tasks become frustrating, painful experiences.\n\n***Fey Influence.*** When mites are about, creatures become irritable and easily frustrated to the point of violence. For such creatures, every minor failure feels like gross incompetence. Simple tasks become increasingly difficult. Those who undertake those tasks become overwhelmed with a sense of unresolved anger and frustration that demands an outlet\u2014usually violence and destruction. The mites' influence can thus turn even the most orderly group into a mob of surly brawlers. Within even the most tight-knit adventuring party, morale plummets, arguments boil over into fights, and discipline becomes spotty at best.\n\n***Chaotic Battlegrounds.*** Dungeons infested with mites for a long period of time devolve into chaotic battlegrounds. Even under the control of a strong leader, any faction in such a dungeon can see its members turn against each other as their frustration and antipathy build. When adventurers enter the dungeon, the mites go to work to exploit the added chaos. They use their magic to drag visitors into their web of anger and frustration, luring explorers deeper into the site and into situations and locations that promise to yield up the most havoc.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Source: [Mordenkainen\u2019s Fiendish Folio, page 44](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#mite_mff)\n\n\\\n",

Elven society enthusiastically though perhaps recklessly embraced the arcane and the mechanical, and excelled at combining the two disciplines. As such, Avalon featured many great magically enhanced technologies unavailable to the rest of the realm.\u00a0 \n\n## [Doom of Avalon](/doc/the-doom-of-avalon-wVeAiTDpDF)\n\nFor the majority of its existence, Avalon was a city of peace, progress and prosperity.\u00a0 This ended abruptly when the first Dragon Emperor, avenging the death of his sister [Drusilla](/doc/drusilla-ggRgUzwcwN), destroyed the city in a cataclysmic event known as *[The Doom of Avalon](/doc/the-doom-of-avalon-wVeAiTDpDF)*. It is unclear, however, the extent to which the total destruction extended to the subterranean, which was considerably more protected than the surface spires. In the aftermath of the explosion, the land upon which the city once stood was laid to waste by wild magic contamination, thus thwarting all attempts to rebuild. Over the centuries, the original location of Avalon was lost to the ages\u2026\n\n# Geography\n\nStructurally, the city consisted of five spires emerging from a valley encircled by glaciated mountains. A central spire featured the great crystal shard, levitating above. The spires were connected by a sophisticated organization of magically powered gondolas. Below the city is the old growth forest of [Eowal\u2019ath.](/doc/eowalath-IYJAAvZG54)\n\nIn the subterranean from where the great crystal shard had emerged, the elves built an elaborate network of the teleportation channels, allowing for instantaneous passage across the planes to those with the magical know how to operate the arcane doors. For this reason, Avalon was also known as *The Gateway City.* \u00a0",

They lair deep in remote forests.\n\nFine strands of silk stream from glands in an ettercap's abdomen, letting it shoot sticky strands of webbing to bind, entrap, or strangle its victims. It can also use its webbing to fashion elaborate snares and nets, which often festoon its lair.\n\n#### Quiet Killers.\n\nWhen travelers and explorers venture into an ettercap's territory, the ettercap stalks them. Some meet their end wandering blindly into traps or sections of forest enclosed by webs. Others, the ettercap garrotes with strands of web or envenoms with its poisonous bite.\n\n#### Enemies of the Fey. \n\nEttercaps are natural enemies of fey creatures. The foul creatures set web snares to catch sprites and pixies, which they hungrily devour, and will encase a dryad's tree in webbing in a vain attempt to trap the dryad. Otherwise timid fey will sometimes approach outsiders for help in dealing with an ettercap infestation, being ill-equipped to deal with the malevolent creatures themselves.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Homebrew\n\n**Sources:** [SRD Basic Rules, page 308](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#ettercap_mm)",

Guilds set prices for the goods or services that they control, and determine who may or may not offer those goods and services. Merchants commonly exchange trade goods without using currency.\n\n\n---\n\n- [x] Homebrew, Source - [Dungeon Church](https://5e.dungeon.church/items.html#painting%20of%20lamont%20solmar_dungeonchurch)\n\n\\\n",

It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.\n\n***Horrifying Visage.*** Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of the ghost that can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened) for 1 minute.

If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost's Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a [greater restoration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/greater-restoration) spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.\n\n***Possession (Recharge 6).*** One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated) and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed) and [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened). It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.\n\nThe possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the [dispel evil and good](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-evil-and-good) spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.\n\n\n---\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=dc0d312c-03a4-4f89-874b-dd225d5ab20e)A ghost is the soul of a once-living creature, bound to haunt a specific location, creature, or object that held significance to it in its life.\n\n***Unfinished Business.*** A ghost yearns to complete some unresolved task from its life. It might seek to avenge its own death, fulfill an oath, or relay a message to a loved one. A ghost might not realize that it has died and continue the everyday routine of its life. Others are driven by wickedness or spite, as with a ghost that refuses to rest until every member of a certain family or organization is dead.\n\nThe surest way to rid an area of a ghost is to resolve its unfinished business. A ghost can be destroyed more easily by invoking a weakness tied to its former life. The ghost of a person tortured to death might be killed again by the implements of that torture. The ghost of a gardener might become more vulnerable when exposed to a potent floral fragrance.\n\n***Ghostly Manifestations.*** Sensations of profound sadness, loneliness, and unfulfilled yearning emanate from places where ghostly hauntings occur. Strange sounds or unnatural silences create an unsettling atmosphere. Cold spots settle in rooms that have roaring fires. A choking stench might seep into the area, inanimate objects might move of their own accord, and corpses might rise from the grave. The ghost has no control over these manifestations; they simply occur.\n\n***Undead Nature.*** A ghost doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Homebrew\n\n**Sources:** !!Book!!, page !!number!!",

The [Riders](/doc/iron-riders-of-abraxas-P77pTaxjou) pull back an injured [Eldan Fletcher](/doc/eldan-fletcher-QWyA10eG7I) and the sounds of hounds baying and reinforcements on their way is heard in the distance. Grey follows them into the thick brush, in his rage deftly dodging the attacks of the [knights](/doc/iron-rider-knight-JIpk2Tegm7) and [hunters](/doc/iron-rider-hunter-kPxugCHSLi) and sinking his glowing sword into the unconscious Eldan, killing him. Grey strikes Saxton, dealing some damage. Surrounded and injured, Grey bashes [Commodore Dan](/doc/commodore-daniel-warrington-OHzOMkhMHS) with his shield and knocks him over, fleeing into the thick forest in the confusion.\n\n> As you navigate through the shadowed depths of the gloomy forest, a flicker of light catches your eye. Hovering just above the undergrowth, a small, luminescent orb pulsates with a soft, inviting glow. The [witchlight](/doc/witchlight-sbRt4HC9Ey)\u2014its light reminiscent of a tiny star lost amid the twisted boughs\u2014begins to drift slowly forward, pausing as if ensuring you are in tow.\\n\n>\n> With a subtle, rhythmic dimming and brightening of its light, it signals to you, a silent beckoning that feels both urgent and reassuring. As it moves, it casts a gentle, ethereal light, illuminating the path ahead, revealing patches of less treacherous ground amid the root-snared earth - worn bricks of some long lost road.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=c3f05bc2-2bdf-4b62-95db-28e0e2aae0ba)He rejoins the party to find them following a [witchlight](/doc/witchlight-sbRt4HC9Ey) along a subtle path in the woods, small hints of elven runes in the rocks and cobblestones that dot the overgrown path. Ama translates one reading \u2018*[AVALON](/doc/avalon-7amKaC2AMg)*\u2019. They doff healing potions and talk about how they can find a place to rest until morning, when the hunt will be called off.\n\n# Cabin in the Woods\n\nAs they walk through the darkened forest, they come across a tree with a bucket nailed to it. A small, hand painted says \u201cDONATIONS\u201d in an unsteady hand. They look inside and see human fingers in various states of decay. They investigate the area and find some discarded bottles with the lingering scent of a potion solvent.\n\nNot sure what to make of this, they deposit some owlbear feathers, a spritz of dragon\u2019s blood, and Bahruhn cuts his finger and leaves an offering of his own.\n\n> As you push through the dense, whispering underbrush, a small, weathered cabin emerges from the fog, its crooked silhouette a stark contrast against the oppressive gloom of the forest. The cabin's wooden planks are gnarled and moss-covered, bearing the scars of countless storms. A thin wisp of smoke curls lazily from the crooked chimney, suggesting the presence of life in this forsaken place. Around the cabin, the ground is littered with the forms of various animals, each lying still as if in death's embrace, casting an eerie stillness over the scene.\n\nAs they keep following the witchlight, it skirts a small meadow with a cabin. A low, thick fog hovers over the ground in the moonlight. Smoke and the enticing smell of something cooking wafts towards them. Ama uses her Mage Hand to see if she can get close enough to knock on the door, but as the mist parts as it flies through the meadow the party sees many undead animals, who move slowly and turn their heads lazily to look at the party. A deer with bloody velvet hanging from it\u2019s antlers eyes them with glowing eyes.\n\nAma decides to not disturb the undead animals. Instead, with backup from the party, she sneaks through the fog to see if she can get a look in the window of the cabin, carefully treading around the still creatures. She does so, and sees [an old druid with many mosses and lichens braided in his dirty white beard](/doc/caelum-the-druid-SHH5bzkRpF). In the house are lines of shelves filled with familiar looking potion bottles. The old druid stirs a pot of soup intently, and Ama can smell it\u2026 it smells very good.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=8d68a97d-72c5-40f1-9b5f-e3d1e4f411a8)The party decides they do not want to stop here to ask for shelter, and they continue following the witchlight further into the woods. The sound of the baying hounds has gotten further in the distance, and their exhaustion is starting to take it\u2019s toll on them. They start to look for a good place to erect their [Tiny Hut](/doc/leomunds-tiny-hut-Nbn6HCph7L).\n\nThey notice that they are being followed by a glowing set of eyes\u2026. several [zombie raccoons](/doc/zombie-raccoon-kRMzfO1jg9) tail them at a distance.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=b6e471d2-aba0-4f6b-80e9-7d608f080d6f)\n\n# The Elven Ruins\n\nThe witchlight finally comes to stop at 4 near-fallen arches, the ruins of some once larger structure, blinking enthusiastically. Elven runes and old cobblestones overgrown with vines litter this courtyard. With the party exhausted, they decide this must be a good place to rest now that they have gained some distance on the hunters. Ama pitches her magical adobe hut, and for the first time in many sleepless hours, the party finally sits down to rest. Ama challenges Bahruhn to a game of Dragonchess, she wins. Bahruhn: 0 Ama: 1 \n\nThrough the magical walls of the hut, they watch as several of the raccoons come to investigate curiously, sniffing around the hut, but they cannot enter. The party wakes up after a long rest. Rado and Ama are both struck with exhaustion as a result of consuming the Midnight Oil potion. When they step outside, they find the raccoons have left a strange offering - a chewed up human finger and a small piece of quartz crystal. Rado pockets the crystal. \n\nExamining the ruins in the dark of night, the party sees that each arch has a triangle shaped hole at it\u2019s peak. The witchlight does a pirouette around one of the arches columns, and Ama notices that her [Collector of Souls](/doc/collector-of-souls-XA0hpJ7gfE) is once again glowing a subtle magenta color. She uses her mage hand to place it in the appropriate spot, and as soon as she does magic light races down the column, spreading to the other columns.\n\nThe air hums as the whole area comes alive with the grinding of stones and whirring of some great unseen machine: in the center of the columns, the floor opens up to reveal a staircase leading down into the earth. They retrieve their artifact, and descend.\n\n# Into the Dungeon\n\n## Central Chamber\n\n> As you step into the grand central chamber of the ruins, your eyes are immediately drawn to the intricate mosaic on the floor, depicting the convergence of multiple grooves in it\u2019s geometric lines - a pattern reminiscent of an astrology map. The room is vast, with high vaulted ceilings supported by rows of crumbling stone columns, each carved with elven script and symbols of magical power. The air here hums with a palpable energy, and the lines on the mosaic glow faintly, their arcane light casting eerie shadows across the walls.\\n\\nAt the four corners of the mosaic are four empty altars.\n\nThey investigate this chamber and find clues to it\u2019s meaning or function: the same geometric pattern is repeated in the frescoes and mosaic lines - all converging at specific angles from 4 points. They notice this mirrors the placement of the altars. Rado detects the strong presence of transmutation flowing through this place. Ama interprets writing on the wall which reads \u201cThrough the light of the crystal, Avalon leads the lost home\u201d\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=3b53e030-38f2-46fe-b65d-447f4ff07a61)\n\n## Guarded Altar\n\nSeveral doors lead out from this central chamber. They take the east one, and follow a long dark hallway to the south. They find another pyramid shaped crystal - this one glowing blue - sitting on an altar surrounded by giant stone elven statues. As they approach they note it\u2019s similarity to the Collector of Souls, and swipe it off the dais. As soon as they lift it, they hear the *click* of a pressure switch from underneath the treasure.\n\nImmediately, the stone statues move, the sound of grinding granite filling the room. One raises it\u2019s weapon and booms out:\n\n> **HALT! WHO GOES THERE? WHAT IS THE PASSWORD?**\n\nThe party immediately answers, \u201cOh don\u2019t worry - [Estelar]() sent us, it\u2019s an emergency!\u201d\n\n> **THE DEFENDERS OF AVALON! CARRY ON!**\n\nThey try to ask it some more questions, but it has already turned back into inanimate rock.\n\n## Laser Altar\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=a5c61c52-dc24-4670-8d78-d6a9855c607e)\n\nExploring to the north of this place, they find a similar circular room with an empty altar. This time there are red lasers beaming up from the floor, humming menacingly with crackling energy. Each beam hits the round roof of this room, refracting around in a dazzling light show as it criss crosses the other beams. Around the altar are 4 mirrors, and a door to the east.\n\nThe party takes the mirrors and uses them to reflect the lasers, careful to not hit each other, by aiming them at the empty altar. Nothing happens.\n\nThey decide to bust down to the rusty door to the east, and find some sort of control room. Pipes and other apparatuses hum with arcane energy, a spattering of dials still providing read outs on their operations. Tacked to the wall is an engineer\u2019s drawing - depicting the same geometric pattern they\u2019ve seen before.\n\nThey arrange themselves to reflect the lasers in this pattern, and from the ceiling comes floating down on a red beam of light another crystal pyramid, this one glowing red. They try a door to the west, but find it locked and water leaking from under it.\n\n## Broken Altar\n\nThe party backtracks to the central chamber, and steels themselves to explore to the western end of this dungeon.\n\n> As you enter the southwestern chamber, the air is thick with the weight of history and the scent of decay. The remnants of a highly advanced and magical technology are scattered around the room, their once-glorious mechanisms now tarnished by time and stripped by looters and the ravages of time. The altar, made of gleaming white stone, is adorned with intricate carvings and inlaid with faded runes.\n>\n> Behind the altar, you notice a series of hollowed-out metal sockets and the charred remains of conduits that once pulsed with arcane energy, leading towards a shattered crystalline core.\\n\\nThe floor is littered with fragments of gears, shattered glass, and remnants of copper wiring, all discolored and crumbling from exposure and neglect\n\nThe party picks their way among the wreckage, looking to a metal door inset in the western wall. Like the rest of this place, they find evidence of some infusion of magic and technology, obviously the work of elves. But as they pick through the remnants of whatever machine powered this altar, they are ambushed by a nest of [Rust Monsters](/doc/rust-monsters-IDoTPoL9oJ).\n\nThe monsters key in on Grey\u2019s glowing sword, but they recoil at it\u2019s magic nature. Luckily for the party no one is wearing heavy armor, and they are able to slash these foul and hungry bugs down before they can do any major damage to the party or their equipment. Grey knocks one of the bugs unconscious, while Ama uses a Sleep spell to subdue the others. Grey wraps the bugs and secures them to his pack.\n\nWith the bugs unconscious and bound, they turn their attention to the western door.\n\nAs they open this room they hear a *hiss* of pressure being released.\n\n## The Lost Elves\n\n> You step into a small, dark chamber filled with a haunting sight. Strewn across the floor are hundreds of pairs of shoes and cloaks, neatly arranged in rows. From delicate elven slippers to sturdy leather boots, all covered in a thick layer of dust. The air is heavy with an indescribable sorrow, as if the very walls of this room still echo with the voices of the elves who abandoned this place. Broken crates and scattered belongings, as if these things were left in haste or some great hurry. Among the scattered shoes and remnants, a delicate elven harp lies broken in a corner, its strings silent.\n>\n> \\nA large stone door, barricaded from this side, lies opposite you.\n\nBahruhn goes to the harp and sees it\u2019s sad state, but leaves it alone. They examine the lines of shoes and cloaks, as if the elves here simply vanished into thin air. The party\u2019s knowledge of history isn\u2019t that great - they think they\u2019ve heard legends of a lost city of elves, but not what happened to them.\n\nThe sadness of this place overcomes them, and they leave it behind without touching anything.\n\n## Flooded Altar\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=420288a6-3ddd-4ed7-a440-8ad1e86a006f)In the center of the northernmost chamber, they find another circular room with an altar - this one an elven statue with water flowing from it\u2019s hands. This room has long become flooded and clogged with detritus. Lily pads bloom on the dark surface of the water, and clouds of gnats hover around the party as they stand knee deep in it\u2019s murkiness.\n\nGrey feels suspicious of these lily pads, and sticks out a long javelin to poke at one. it folds in on itself, revealing teeth, and snaps the end of the wooden. The water churns and a [humanoid aberration](/doc/humanoid-aberration-Qvo2CGbmZF) stands up, dripping wet. This figure does not have a head where a human would have one, but it\u2019s torso opens up to display a giant gaping mouth. Tendrils shoot out of it and towards the party, grappling them and spraying poison around the room. Bahruhn and Ama are chomped by the aberration, taking serious damage. The gnats thicken and attempt to fly into the parties ears and eyes. Rado casts Vampiric Touch and kills a [clouds of gnats](/doc/clouds-of-gnats-lHfxXpkKsF).\n\nThe party reacts by striking at the tendrils that grapple them. Grey does some damage but the tendrils keep coming and the poison starts to get to them. Ama is the only one not weighed down by the thick, churning water and simply walks across it, batting gnats out of her face, she whispers the words to Shatter - and the infernal aberration explodes in a thick, disgusting layer of gore and miasma. From it\u2019s stomach it vomits another subtlety glowing crystal - the last piece of the puzzle to power whatever machine the elves have buried here.\n\n\\\nThe party ventures back to the room with the red lasers to see if they can gain entry to the other door. Bahruhn kicks down the door with ease. Inside they find a chest, upon opening this chest they discover a clay tablet inscribed with the same sigil from the main room. \n\n\n---\n\n- [x] Dungeon Church Homebrew added: [Iron Rider Knight](/doc/iron-rider-knight-JIpk2Tegm7) & [Hunter](/doc/iron-rider-hunter-kPxugCHSLi), [Zombie Raccoon](/doc/zombie-raccoon-kRMzfO1jg9), [Rationing Spice](/doc/rationing-spice-iguPtdfdS2)\n\n\\\n",

It appears as a floating ball of flickering light similar to a will-o'-wisp. The hue of quartz used during the creature's creation determines the color of each witchlight's illumination. After the quartz is prepared, it is animated through an extended magical ritual cast under a full moon and a clear, starry sky. Consequently, they are extremely rare by any measure.\n\n***Flashing Light Code.*** A witchlight always shares the same alignment as its creator. Although it cannot speak, a witchlight understands Common or another language taught it by its creator. Many spellcasters have taught their witchlights a coded cipher, so it can spell out words by flaring and dimming its light. When necessary, a witchlight can spell words in the air by flying so quickly that its trail of light forms letters. This stunt requires a successful DC 14 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check per word.\n\n***Free Roaming.*** If the witchlight's master dies within one mile of the witchlight, it explodes in a brilliant but harmless flash of light. If it loses its master under any other circumstance, it becomes masterless; it's free to do as it pleases, and it can never serve anyone else as a familiar. The statistics below represent these independent witchlights.\n\nEvil witchlights can be surprisingly cruel, not unlike will-o'- wisps. They seek to lure lost travelers into swamps or traps by using their glow to imitate the light of a safe haven. Conversely, good-aligned witchlights guide travelers to places of safety or along safe paths, and they are prized by pilots and guides. Neutral witchlights exhibit a playful nature\u2014sometimes mingling inside the cavities of weapons, gems, or other curiosities, which means those items may be mistaken for magic items. More than one \"wizard's staff \" is just an impressive looking stick with a witchlight perched on top.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Source [Kobold Tome of Beasts 1](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#witchlight_tob)\n\n\\\n",

Other creatures use the fungi as an alarm to signal the approach of prey, and various intelligent races of the Underdark cultivate shriekers on the outskirts of their communities to discourage trespassers.\n\n# Fungi\n\nWith its sky of jagged stone and perpetual night, the Underdark is home to all manner of fungi. Taking the place of plants in the subterranean realm, fungi are vital to the survival of many underground species, providing nourishment and shelter in the unforgiving darkness.\n\nFungi spawn in organic matter, then break that matter down to consume it, feeding on filth and corpses. As they mature, fungi eject spores that drift on the lightest breeze to spawn new fungi.\n\nNot needing sunlight or warmth to grow, fungi thrive in every corner and crevice of the Underdark. Transformed by the magic that permeates that underground realm, Underdark fungi often develop potent defensive mechanisms or abilities of mimicry and attack. The largest specimens can spread to create vast subterranean forests in which countless creatures live and feed.\n\n\n---\n\n- [ ] Source - [Monster Manual, page 138](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#shrieker_mm)\n\n\\\n",

Standing in the grand central chamber of this elvish ruin, their bag of holding full of crystal artifacts, they hear footsteps coming down the worn stone stairwell. Grey readies himself for battle at the entrance, but they hear the familiar voice of Greyson call out. Ama answers him and the party is reunited. Both Greyson and his new friend Ramoth the dragonborn warlock are both out of breath, explaining that they got held up by the [briar children](/doc/child-of-the-briar-sI5pUsj9VA).\n\nAs they catch up, they hear the baying of the huntsmen\u2019s hounds in the not so far off distance.\n\nAma pulls out the crystals and matches them by color to their respective to each empty altar. As she does so, the altar glows and lines of energy flow from it down into the mosaic on the floor, lighting up the arcane geometry. When the final piece is put in place\u2026\n\n> A resonant hum fills the air, harmonizing with the faint whispers in evlish that seem to echo from the walls of the ruins.\\n\n>\n> The ground beneath you vibrates, sending ripples through the dust and debris. The light from the crystals grows brighter, their beams converging in the center of the room. There, the very fabric of reality seems to tear open, revealing a swirling vortex of planar energy. The portal shimmers, a kaleidoscope of colors and shapes, its surface rippling like the surface of a disturbed pond.\\n\n>\n> A rush of wind pulls at your clothes and hair, carrying with it the scent of ozone. \n\nThe party steps through the portal.\n\n# Blast to the Past\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvEl7Bn-720&source%5Fve%5Fpath=OTY3MTQ&feature=emb%5Fimp%5Fwoyt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvEl7Bn-720&source%5Fve%5Fpath=OTY3MTQ&feature=emb%5Fimp%5Fwoyt)\n\n> As you step through the swirling portal, your are thrown through a cosmic tunnel.

She is tall and slender, with long, silver hair braided with threads of gold and studded with glowing crystals. She looks at you with both relief and urgency.\\n\\n\u201dAt last, you have arrived.\u201d she exclaims, her voice a melodic blend of strength and grace. \"Just as [Estelar's](/doc/estelar-the-heretic-OtEcj9hL0Z) prophecy foretold! We are in desperate need of your aid. The fate of [Avalon](/doc/avalon-7amKaC2AMg) hangs by a thread - [we are under siege](/doc/the-doom-of-avalon-wVeAiTDpDF) by [the Empire](/doc/dragon-empire-odzVqtQPbm)!\u201d She gestures to the view, the sky cloudy with the haze of smoke\u2026.\n\nThe party collects themselves off the floor of the gondola and takes in the scene before them.\n\nAma introduces herself, and the elf answers: \u201cOh yes, I am [Leshanna Starwhisper](/doc/leshanna-starwhisper-hyyvxrFCai) - Guardian of Avalon!\u201d\n\nThe others look out the window and see the earth a dizzying distance below the gondola lift. Five massive spires emerge from the forest canopy below, strung with gondola lines between them. The air is thick with smoke, as massive advancing lines of troops with terrible fire-belching war machines clearing a path through the woods towards the towers. A large, magnificent black dragon swoops through the air above.\n\nLeshanna twists some knobs at the control panel of the gondola and says, \u201cI must ask - you did bring the artifact with you.. right?\u201d Ama pulls out the glowing magenta [Collector of Souls](/doc/collector-of-souls-XA0hpJ7gfE).\n\n\u201cYes! You must deliver it to the dragonborn rebels led by [Razorback](/doc/razorback-the-uniter-O3oe7NBQqK), it is our only hope. We must evacuate the people of Avalon through the portals, but it takes time. If the rebels can push back the Imperial forces\u2026\"\n\nAt the mention of Razorback, Ramoth realizes the stakes - they have somehow traveled to the past, and the fate of her people depend on this prophecy being fulfilled. After a discussion on the nature of time travel and free will, they ask what they must do.\n\nLeshanna tells them they are traveling towards a little used maintenance tower, which has access to the underground network of tunnels beneath Avalon. Through these, they can reach the bunker the rebels have seized and deliver the artifact.\n\nThe elf takes [a ground crystal lens set in an intricate silver apparatus](/doc/ley-line-lens-A8oN3yTn4x) and says, \u201cThis will guide you, when you reach the tunnels, use it to find your way.\u201d\n\nThe gondola lurches to a stop at a stone platform with a narrow bridge leading to an old, crumbling tower.\n\n# The Tower\n\n>  ![The Tower](/api/attachments.redirect?id=220c9b53-26c1-46a7-a8c1-d681532a92c1 \"right-50\")The once-pristine elven structure reaches out of the forest\u2019s canopy, now covered in a tangle of overgrown vines, colorful lichens, and bundles of wire terminations attached to the exterior of this utilitarian sentinel . The elegant stonework and intricate metal filigree are obscured by The vines that have twisted through the intricate gears and mechanisms that adorn the tower. \\n\\nAt the top of the tower\u2019s spire, perched like a malevolent crown, a massive chaotic nest sprawls across the rooftop, constructed from a mix of twisted branches, shattered machinery, and old gondola lift lines. \\n\\nThe air thrums with a deep, resonant buzz of the agitated nest\u2019s guardian, zipping around in the clouds of smoke that drift past, obscuring your vision of this great winged dragonfly-like creature.\n\nThe party ventures along the narrow stone bridge towards the tower, which is coated in mud and other detritus from the large insect nest. Several curious [sunflies](/doc/sunflies-dxLQLYnJsa), radiating light like torches, fly around the party. Ama uses [speak with animals](/doc/speak-with-animals-g0PInjgOVl) to see if they have anything to say, and they only reply, \u201c*BIG MAMA!*\u201d\n\nThe [gargantuan dragonfly](/doc/gargantuan-dragonfly-bRaaQOBXPa) creature darts about above them, it\u2019s great wings beating the air with a heavy drone. The party attempts several attacks that just glance off it\u2019s armor-like exoskeleton. Agitated from the smoke and dragon flying around, it does a great flying dive at Greyson, who uncannily dodges it\u2019s attempt at grappling him. The sunflies are no longer docile, but buzz around the party attempting to sting and distract them. Seeing that the attacks are ineffective, Grey and the others run towards the mud-covered door of the tower and begin to hack away at the layer of mud. Ama uses Shatter and Ramoth also casts spells, agitating the great insect even more.\n\nThe black dragon flies by using it\u2019s dragon\u2019s breath to ignite the insect\u2019s nest. It buzzes around with it\u2019s droning wings, knocking Greyson unconscious. As the party finally gets the door open, Grey runs back to grab him. As they make a final run into the now open door of the tower, the Dawnfly smashes the roof of the tower, sending flaming debris falling into the forest far below.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=c6db455c-a888-4f9b-8528-8d098f207625)\n\n## Wild Magic Storage Room\n\n> As you step into the room, a wave of chaotic energy washes over you. The air crackles with wild magic from four cracked, glass reservoirs leaking brightly colored liquids into a large puddle in the center of the room. Tangles of wires, furniture, tools and broken machinery litter the room, mixing with the glowing, rainbow colored liquids. The energy hums and pulses, filling the space with an almost palpable sense of unpredictability.\n\nAs the party explores the room and detritus here, they begin to notice that things are not as they seem. The furniture shifts in the corners of their eyes, and anyone who touches the strange liquids fills a chill of wild magic explode from the contact - Ama loses her hair, and Ramoth uses the glowing liquid as face paint that gives her an action surge. Ramoth continues picking some strange looking potion bottles off the shelves, while Grey notices there is no obvious door leading from this room. He sees a bear skin rug covering the floor, and pulls it out to uncover a trap door inset. \n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=c82c57e3-133b-41ee-a2c9-7542fa66f244 \"left-50\")Unfortunately, the rug roars and bear hugs Grey, wrapping itself around him. The others begin to attack it, but hear Grey grunting in pain from the inside. At this moment the strange things in this room come to live - they get blasted by a [saxophone](/doc/animated-instrument-m3ztxW8UOW), a [swarm of books](/doc/swarm-of-animated-books-6gLv4mcFXc) throw themselves through the air, and [a table](/doc/animated-table-Pt41sK9mJc) and [broom](/doc/animated-broom-w3n67HjlcT) charge them. The party fights back, and Ramoth summons her pact weapon and soon the constructs are returning to non-animated forms. They manage to get the trap door open, and Grey bursts free of the bear skin rug\u2019s embrace. He pushes the others into the open hole and leaps backwards into it, crashing into the ground 2 stories below. Dusting himself off, he races back up the ladder past his companions to finish off the animated enemies.\n\n## The Knowledge Seeker\n\n ![Number Fourteen, the Knowledge Seeker](/api/attachments.redirect?id=a0c9599a-406d-4c7f-a41a-5b5e041d15f6)\n\n> You descend into a softly lit room where candles burn in elaborate metal sconces hanging from the walls, which are lined with floor to ceiling shelves containing dusty books with elven script on their bindings.\\n\\nFloating tomes drift in the room around you, their covers opening and closing slowly as if engaging in silent conversation with each other, carried by some unseen force that keeps them aloft. In the center of the room sits a remarkable construct, a melding of parchment, gears, and arcane typewriters of some elvish type, busily transcribing information into a new book.\\n\\nOne of the books cries out:\\n**VISITORS!**\\nanother: **SEEKERS OF KNOWLEDGE??**\\n\\n\u201dOh dear, where are my manners - welcome novel friends, I am pleased to make your acquaintance. I am the custodian of this archive, and it has been quiet a while since any have visited me here. Would you be so kind as to state your names for the record?\u201d\\n\\nWith a flourish the machine reaches with one of it\u2019s many mechanical arms and draws a new page into his typewriter.\n\nThe half paper half man half typewriter construct records their names, and informs them that since they are from the future, he would love to know some new and unique information. \u201cFact for fact! Information is vital, and the tower\u2019s secrets are not freely given!\u201d\n\nThey attempt to conjure up some history, which he mostly already knows. He tells them he is a part of the Avalon Public Library system (Maintenance Archive #32) and makes them library cards once they start offering up some new information from the future. He pours Ama a hot tea out of his mechanical elbow. The party asks him some questions - he says he is #14 of his master\u2019s experiments, that Avalon\u2019s fate was foretold by [Estelar the Heretic](/doc/estelar-the-heretic-OtEcj9hL0Z) of the [Infernal Circle](/doc/the-infernal-circle-8nyqHyTQO2), and also that there is an elevator in the tower. Much intrigued by this fact, the party gives #14 a few more facts before he unlocks the elevator for them and wishes them good luck.\n\n## Below the Tower\n\n> The elevator finally dings, and the doors open into a small stone room, the personal quarters of some architect or wizard.\\n\\nA chaotic array of workbenches covered in ancient schematics, rusted tools, and scattered arcane components. The air is thick with the scent of oil and old parchment, mingling with an underlying metallic tang. Shelves line the walls, filled with vials of strange liquids and jars of preserved organic matter, their labels faded and unreadable.\\n\n>\n> In the center of the room, a large, partially disassembled automaton lies sprawled across a table, its once-sleek form now a twisted mess of gears and wires. A series of enchanted crystals embedded in its chest flicker weakly.\n\nThe party pokes about this strange room, they find many drawings that they recognize as the gondola lifts they came to the tower on. They find a journal that appears to contain the notes of scientific experiments, something about crystals and souls and fusing it with machines. Ama, being the only one who can read elvish, flips through it and finds that the journal begins to make less and less sense the further she gets into it, the writing growing more erratic and the penmanship unsteady. It is signed [Elarion Gearsong](/doc/elarion-gearsong-5hUorix4Zk).\n\nThey decide not to touch the construct on the table, although they note it has the number 19 inscribed on it\u2019s forehead. They open the door into a flooded hallway filled with sewage..\n\n# The Tunnels\n\nAma is able to walk on top of the foul waters, but Greyson attempts to wade into it and immediately feels sickness and poison overcome him. Bahruhn hitches a ride on Grey\u2019s back, while Ramoth uses [Spider Climb](/doc/spider-climb-H6nEMZuLZV) to traverse the slippery cobbled walls of these tunnels. They make their way through the hazy, fog filled passage to another door.\n\nRamoth opens it, and Bahruhn flips inside. they find a large, floating eyeball with decaying flesh hanging from it\u2019s many eyeball-stalk tendrils. The room is covered with old bloodstains, and rusty shackles hang from the walls. The [zombie beholder](/doc/zombie-beholder-98ylojBtWx) attacks with it\u2019s disintegration ray, but the party overwhelms it with their superior numbers by surrounding it. Ramoth sinks the killing blow.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=e3dccaac-2986-4ad2-8ae3-b58500279aed)\n\nFollowing the sewage filled tunnel further into the darkness, they see hundreds of rats running towards them, fleeing in the opposite direction\u2026 something has disturbed them and send them running in fear. The party hears metallic footsteps.\n\nThey come to a stone bridge that goes over the water. Ahead in the darkness, they see the two glowing red eyes of a [clockwork construct](/doc/clockwork-construct-ovzS6Ccvnk) flanked by two other [robots](/doc/robots-uX906NOf0f). Grey unleashes the [rust monsters](/doc/rust-monster-IDoTPoL9oJ) they\u2019ve been hauling around, and they run at the robots. The leader is untouched by their antenna, but one of the others loses an arm.\n\nThe leading construct unfolds it\u2019s chest open, a nozzle appears, and sprays the entire party and bridge with grease. Ramoth casts [Hunger of Hadar](/doc/hunger-of-hadar-o5nJP85vWG) around the constructs, and they repeatedly suffer eldritch damage in the tight quarters. One of the constructs advances forward recklessly, blowing his face up. The other is distracted by the rust monsters and is quickly surrounded by the party, who fence them in up against the dark magic of Ramoth\u2019s spell.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=2623bbe0-9bcd-4428-9692-d407744fc35c)\n\nAs the party begins to get the upper hand, the clockwork construct unleashes a torrent of fire, setting the tunnel, the bridge, and most of the party on fire. The party abandons the higher ground of the bridge, and what is left of his robot companions advance forward without care for their animated forms, and suicide bomb the bridge. It tumbles and falls in a flaming pile of debris with the clockwork man on the other side.\n\n ![Tunnels beneath Avalon Maintenance Tower #32](/api/attachments.redirect?id=92b81763-3315-470f-a182-881cc99eae5d)\n\n\\\n",

[See below](https://lore.dungeon.church/doc/virtual-table-player-info-GKIAmafFdH#h-character-creation) for character creation instructions.\n\n# Resources\n\n* [FoundryVTT Discord](https://discord.gg/foundryvtt) has help channels\n* [FoundryVTT Knowledge Base](https://foundryvtt.com/kb/) has a Getting Started section\n* [FoundryVTT Keyboard Shortcut reference](https://foundryvtt.com/article/controls/)\n* [5eTools Discord](https://discord.gg/5etools) for help with Plutonium or 5eTools. \n  * ==Don\u2019t talk about 5eTools/Plutonium elsewhere== - most D&D spaces will ban you for \u201cpiracy\u201d :face_with_rolling_eyes:\n\n## Recommended Foundry Setup\n\n\n:::success\nFoundry runs in your browser. There is also a standalone [Foundry Lightweight Client](https://foundry.ruleplaying.com/flc) app that may help if you are having compatibility issues or using an older computer.\n\n:::\n\n\n:::info\n**\u2699\ufe0f** FoundryVTT Settings Tab **\u27a1\ufe0f** Configure Settings\n\n:::\n\n* Left Click to Release Objects - `Checked` idk why this isn\u2019t default behavior\n* Maximum Framerate `30` - 30 is plenty, go to `15` if your computer sucks\n* **\\[**:apple: **Mac Users\\]** Pixel Ratio Scaling `Off` - improves performance on Retina screens significantly\n* :potato: **Potato Computers \ud83e\udd54**: In the Foundry settings, there are a bunch of settings for the various animations and special effects. If you\u2019re still struggling, turn all of these off. You should also run the Discord call from a different device (ie. your phone, game console, tablet, etc.) since Discord itself is pretty resource intensive.\n* :warning: These settings are stored locally in your browser. If you switch computers, browsers, or clear your browser cache you will need to go back in and adjust them again.\n\n\n:::tip\nIt definitely helps to play Foundry with both a **keyboard *and* mouse**, just like you would a PC game! Get a nerdy headset, make sure all your stuff is charged and plugged in, set up a 2nd monitor/device if you\u2019ve got one, and get comfy :nerd_face:\n\n:::\n\n### Useful Shortcut Keys\n\n| **Shortcut** | **Action** |\n|:---:|----|\n| c | Toggle character sheet |\n| t | Target selected token |\n| Shift + Click to Roll | Roll normally & skip popup |\n| Control + Click to Roll | Roll Blind to GM |\n\n## Basic Troubleshooting\n\n\n1. FoundryVTT is officially designed for **Chrome** browser. **Firefox** also works fine. ==Before you try anything else, switch to Chrome tho== & make sure you're on the latest version. Safari **is not supported and does not work**.\n2. [Check your browsers 3D settings](https://foundry.ruleplaying.com/gpu) with this site. [Turn on hardware acceleration in your browser](https://forums.forge-vtt.com/docs?topic=11296 \"Turn on hardware acceleration in your browser\n   \n   (https://forums.forge-vtt.com/docs?topic=11296)\") if not - in many cases it's off by default (especially on laptops). This helps a lot!\n3. **Password manager & adblocker plugins are known to interfere** with Foundry! Turn them off or whitelist the `dungeon.church` domain in their settings.\n4. Foundry is a DIY solution and highly customizable - anything can be changed. If you're having issues or wish something worked differently, let me know.\n\n# Character Creation\n\nYou can use the Charactermancer feature to easily guide you through making your character. It is powered by our 5etools mirror at [https://5e.dungeon.church](https://5e.dungeon.church.)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAxAoL6-NCw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAxAoL6-NCw)\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n* Log in to Foundry\n* `Create New Actor` in the **\ud83d\udc64** **Actors** tab\n* Open your new sheet, then access the `Charactermancer` from the `\u2026` menu in top right.\n* This will guide you through the steps of making a character. In the left hand pane are the choices you need to make, in the right hand pane is a reference for the relevant rules.\n* You can also use this to level up or multi-class\n\n\n:::tip\n:printer: You can print your FoundryVTT characters for playing at a physical table! \\n\\nRight click on your character in the **Actors** tab, then select **Export Sheet**.\\n\\nThe PDF also includes item & spell cards :magic_wand:\n\n:::\n\n## Importing with Plutonium\n\nPlutonium Import is used for importing individual features, items, spells, etc. from 5etools into your sheet. You can also make your character this way if you prefer a little more hands on approach. Just add each thing you need using the importer:\n\n* Go to the :bust_in_silhouette: **Actors** tab in the right sidebar, open up your character sheet. Select `Plutonium Import` from `\u2026` Menu.\n* From the left column, select each feature you need to import one at a time (**Item, Spell, etc)**. Click \"Open Importer\". Make your selection and it will be added to your sheet. \n\n\\\n ![You can import all character features individually using Plutonium.

When you have 5etools and Foundry open at the same time, you will see a paper airplane icon to send to Foundry.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=39c74afd-7d54-4fb1-bb48-3610133fd76e)If you want to add a feature or item to your character sheet, you can \u201c**Set as Rivet Target**\u201d to send it there.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=d1058874-b2e1-4150-b159-cb5dcb20d65f)\n\n# Additional Help\n\n## Preparing Spells\n\nIf you are playing a spellcaster class that [prepares your spells](https://5e.dungeon.church/book.html#phb,10,known%20and%20prepared%20spells,0), you have a *known* spell list and a *prepared* spell list. The importer will add all *known* spells to your sheet according to your class & level. To select which spells you have *prepared* there is a **Prepared Spell Mass Toggler** tool in the `\u2026` menu in the top right.\n\nWhen you need to swap spells, use this tool to select **\u2611\ufe0f** which ones you currently have prepared. If you need to add new spells to your known spell list, use the importer to add them individually. \n\n\\\n ![Preparing spells with the Mass Toggler tool](/api/attachments.redirect?id=95a72fe1-3ba2-46d4-86d9-8b19fc8a566e)\n\n## Filtering Your Options\n\nThe filters are very powerful and allow you to focus on just the specific things you are interested in. \n\nDungeon Church\u2019s Pyora setting is listed as a homebrew Source, with source tag red `CHURCH` which is another thing you can filter by.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### ***Your DM told you to use a Pyoran species***\n\nOpen the **Race & Subrace** Importer in Plutonium, then hit **Filter** on the list. \n\nYou can deselect everything (Source: `CLEAR` or `NONE` button) then reselect `Dungeon Church` under Homebrew\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=e722f876-ee24-4059-892f-c3f0232d300a)\n\n#### ***You are a wizard looking for an extremely specific spell.***\n\nYou need a Level 5 spell, divination school so the cost is reduced, and you want to exclude anything that does ice damage because that doesn\u2019t fit in with your character\u2019s vibe.\n\n ![Filter by: 5th level Wizard spell, Divination school, no cold damage](/api/attachments.redirect?id=b02ab21e-a4a1-4477-8a72-cca0018470b3)\n\n#### ***You are a druid who is creating your [initial beast list](/doc/house-rules-OhKbZs6UV4)*\u2026**\n\nGo to the Creature importer and filter by what Beasts are available for [Wild Shape](/doc/wild-shape-bCuGgQx5Y9) in your chosen Environments\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=1fbbdfd2-b37b-4a01-b732-6ab2d69f5fb4)",

Sometimes the rumors claim whole towns were bewitched into bacchanal acts, or driven mad in carnivals beyond comprehension, only to find themselves not only hungover - but bearing a generation of progeny that can only be called special. \\n\\nMore skeptical minds consider these children to have been exposed to magic in the womb, or to be the resurgence of recessive traits from pre-human species lost to the cycle of time.\n\n\n:::info\nElfmarked = \u201cHalf Elf\u201d in the PHB\n\n:::\n\n### Elfmarked Traits\n\nYour elfmarked character has some qualities in common with elves and some that are unique to the elfmarked.\n\n***Ability Score Increase***. Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.\n\n***Age***. Elfmarked mature at the same rate humans do and reach adulthood around the age of 20. They live much longer than humans, however, often exceeding 180 years.\n\n***Alignment***. Elfmarked share the chaotic bent of their elven heritage. They value both personal freedom and creative expression, demonstrating neither love of leaders nor desire for followers. They chafe at rules, resent others' demands, and sometimes prove unreliable, or at least unpredictable.\n\n***Size***. Elfmarked are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.\n\n***Speed***. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\n***Darkvision***. Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\n***Fey Ancestry***. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.\n\n***Skill Versatility***. You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.\n\n***Languages***. You can speak, read, and write Common, Elvish, and one extra language of your choice.\n\n\\\n",

We cut supply lines, steal key resources and raze settlements in order to protect our sacred lands. Cities have grown up around us, it seems new towns emerge no matter how far we roam. \n\nThe blight of humanity threatens the survival of my kind and the future of my family. I will do anything it takes to destroy these demons and drive them back to the realms from whence they came. The vampire [Amelia](/doc/amelia-mAibH1T0Em) despises these vermin as much as I do, and thus I have forged an unholy alliance in her service. I believe she has the power to exterminate the blight that plagues my kind. I believe she will help us to restore the wilds to their former untrammeled glory.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=f679a4d4-aed7-4554-bdca-4d3b1defbe2a)",

An [elfmarked](/doc/elfmarked-ohkfCOb0aT) child, it was hard to say if it was the blood of the Travelers or her parents\u2019 unconventional profession that led her to dog the various captains and crews that visited her home, but in the end, the result was the same. She followed them, she learned from them when they allowed it, and when time came that she could hold her own on the rolling deck of a ship, she signed on with the man who had taken the most interest in her budding career. That man was [Ruhrin Starhelm](/doc/ruhrin-starhelm-w8g2zPDAO5), Captain of the *[Tempest\u2019s Embrace](/doc/tempests-embrace-rwK9njgwMz)*.  \\n\\nPerhaps he saw some measure of himself in her\u2014 he too had been an Elfmarked youth, ripe with potential and drawn inexorably the sea and all it promised. Ultimately, she thrived under his guidance; with a sharp mind and unwavering loyalty, she quickly worked her way through the ship\u2019s ranks and gained the position of First Mate. There, she thrived, guiding the crew through numerous successful raids and defenses against rivals, always upholding the Articles of Agreement that bound the [Confederacy of Hearthships](/doc/confederacy-of-hearthships-EDksxQvprt) together.\n\nIt was not to last. Disaster struck in the form of a marked rogue; a [Tribeborn](/doc/tribeborn-KVgPsdxk3f) [Storm Baron](/doc/storm-barons-9bIflGjrAd) called [Marek,](/doc/baron-marek-jRmX1mC2c5) whose daring had pushed him further than the Articles would give grace for. He had violated the Oaths\u2014 and so, the Tempest\u2019s Embrace had set upon his ship. Justice though, would not prevail that day. The Tempest\u2019s crew was routed. Captain Starhelm was slain, and the creature responsible for his destruction now claimed their ship as his prize.  \\n\\nIn the end, those members of the crew who refused to submit to the druid\u2019s rule were put to the sword and left for dead on an isolated beachhead. Sopia numbered among those who survived, and after burying the remains of their crew, the diminished crew limped to the nearest port of call\u2014 [Saltmarsh](/doc/saltmarsh-GkGI6ISio5).  \\n\n\n# Present Day\n\nNow in Saltmarsh, Sopia is a displaced corsair bent on revenge and justice. Haunted by the loss of her ship and the death of her Captain, she is driven by the need to restore her lost honor and find justice for the fallen Starhelm.\n\n***Personality Traits***\n\n **Loyal** \u2013 Without doubt, Sopia remains loyal to her crew and the Confederacy. Even now, she holds unto the Articles of Agreement. \n\n**Resourceful** \u2013 After being stranded into the wild, Sopia is a resourceful and flexible person.\n\n***Ideals***\n\n**Freedom** \u2013 Valuing freedom on the open sea and the autonomy of the ships of the Confederacy. \\n**Justice** \u2013 Devoted to avenging Captain Starhelm's death and to bringing the Tempest's Embrace back from Marek.\n\n***Bonds***\n\n**Captain Starhelm** \u2013 Sopia feels quite the loyalty to her fallen captain and is driven by vengeance and justice. \n\n**The Crew** \u2013 She considers the remnants her crew her family and will go to great lengths to protect and support them.\n\n***Flaws***\n\n**Vengeful** \u2013 Sopia's desire for revenge against Marek can sometimes cloud her judgment and lead her into dangerous situations. \n\n**Haunted** \u2013 The loss of the Tempest's Embrace and the betrayal by Marek weigh heavily on her mind, sometimes causing her to doubt her decisions.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=1546a582-152d-4351-8bf3-60c3ed8e84e7)\n\n\\\n",

The ground beneath you vibrates, sending ripples through the dust and debris from the ransacked armory that the smoldering ruin of the war machine crashed into. The light from the crystal tower up above the treetops explodes in a wave of energy that knocks the breath out of you, and you see the dragon consumed by it\u2019s expanding light. \\n\\nAnd right in front of you the very fabric of reality seems to tear open, revealing a swirling vortex of planar energy. The portal shimmers, a kaleidoscope of colors and shapes, its surface rippling like the surface of a disturbed pond.\n\nThe party is pulled into the portal, leaving the rebels defending [Avalon](/doc/avalon-7amKaC2AMg) behind, tumbling through time back to whence they came.\n\nThey are deposited back in the [Dreadwood](/doc/dreadwood-GcfKdBzGyT), and they are immediately hit by the oppressive heat and humidity of summer - it is obvious some time has passed. Almost immediately, they are set upon by mosquitos and the air is filled with the din of cicadas.\n\n> Your eyes are drawn to a curious sight: a giant tortoise, tethered to a nearby tree. Its massive, ancient eyes regard you knowingly, a silent witness to your abrupt arrival. The tortoise's weathered shell and steady gaze convey a sense of enduring patience, as if it has been waiting for this moment\n\nSopia emerges from the darkness, out hunting for bandits east of [Burle](/doc/burle-8ZuZ4qZsXt). She introduces herself, and Greyson and Rado attempt to recruit her to the [Gold Scale Company](/doc/gold-scale-company-m1WdlmIYwP). They then turn their attention to the tortoise. Greyson asks the tortoise to blink yes or no in response to his questions, but this doesn\u2019t get them very far, but Rado discerns that this tortoise is not an illusion and Sopia senses no evil. Soon Ama arrives to [Speak with Animals](/doc/speak-with-animals-g0PInjgOVl), and the tortoise\u2019s identity is revealed: [Cerric Shadowleaf](/doc/cerric-shadowleaf-jMvCl3ogF1), who was polymorphed by [Amelia](/doc/amelia-mAibH1T0Em) when the hunters caught him during the hunt.\n\nBefore they can continue the conversation, they hear large animals running through the dense brush. Cerric as tortoise looks very concerned, and pulls himself into his shell.\n\n# Dire Chase\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=f83fc9b2-aa02-4b2d-9fd0-a92f26486390)\n\nA [dire hare](/doc/dire-hare-yQuDMVc6re) runs out into the clearing, it\u2019s eyes perked up and alert. Through the brush, crashing after it, is a [dire boar](/doc/dire-boar-ICD17iMkzY) with long razor sharp tusks. The party attempts to hide themselves and avoid this altercation by climbing trees and hiding. The hare circles around the clearing, drawing the dire boar out. It pauses to catch it\u2019s breath, and sniffs the air\u2026. it can smell the party nearby. Closing in on the tree Sopia has climbed, it charges and knocks her out prone. The party let\u2019s loose their readied actions - Greyson an arrow, Rado\u2019s [Mind Whip](/doc/tashas-mind-whip-sSKkd9gY7b), and Sopia [blesses](/doc/bless-VXwx54zxJt) her comrades. The large beast takes lots of damages as it gores Sopia, who responds with her trident.\n\nAs this is playing out, the dire hare circles more and takes refuge behind a tree\u2026 the same one Greyson and Rado are using for cover. Sensing larger prey, several [Giant Ticks](/doc/giant-tick-HSyctDDnsY) climb off the hare and promptly attached themselves to them, slowly draining their blood.\n\nThe dire boar is finally downed, and the party attempts to pry the ticks off with a crowbar. They are finally defeated, with much blood loss.\n\n# Mists in the Night\n\nWith the night getting late and the Dreadwood\u2019s hostility on full display, Ama casts [Tiny Hut](/doc/leomunds-tiny-hut-Nbn6HCph7L) and the party hunkers down. As they discuss what to do next, and what they know about the hunter\u2019s guild and Lady Nightshade, Ama rummages through her [bag of holding](/doc/bag-of-holding-vaqJdkPRX2) and out falls the vellum map they found deep within [the sunless temple](/doc/sunless-temple-yS5i3gqWiO).\n\nThey examine it together, trying to figure out where they are on relation to Burle and the places shown on the map\u2026 a village marked Duskmire, and a symbol of an inn or house halfway there.\n\nLater in the night, most of the party is awakened by a feeling of dread. A low mist unfurls itself beneath the crack of the door. Outside the windows, the forest appears to have dissapeared and they float in a field of mist. [Amelia](/doc/amelia-mAibH1T0Em) appears in her red dress - staring deep into Ama\u2019s eyes, beckoning to her and attempting to charm her.\n\nAs they watch in horror they see she is accompanied by two young boys, dark silhouettes by her side.\n\nThe mists fade and the party sleeps fitfully until dawn.\n\n# The Way to Duskmire\n\nDeciding Burle is too hot, they attempt to locate themselves and find the clearest way to Duskmire where at least they are unknown. Sopia sends up her owl to scout, they decide to head north following a faint game trail through the brush.\n\nAfter some time they come to a clearing where an owl and several squirrels seem to be attacking a goblin stuck in a tree. As the party takes in this situation, they attempt to scare off the animals. One of the squirrels steals a bag of nuts from the goblin, and they all finally run off. The party helps the goblin get down from the tree, and he explains his name is [Frik](/doc/frek-ZZFJyApC0v). He says he escaped from a dungeon run by the \u201ccruel red lady\u201d, and his brother Frack is still there in the tunnels. Ama gives him a ration, and he scampers on his goblin way.\n\nThe game trail gradually becomes a path and finally a gravel road wide enough for a carriage. The trees here are covered in spanish moss and colorful lichens, glistening in the humidity. The road leads to a single street town, where every building is boarded up and decrepit, covered in vines and mosses, long abandoned.\n\n# The House\n\nThe mists swirls amongst the abandoned buildings. Off to the left, the party sees two children standing outside a wrought iron fence. The younger of the two is crying, clutching a doll.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=39a92823-bf9b-4473-a8c3-bbf0faadf834)They call out, \u201cPlease help us!! There is a monster in the basement! We need help!\u201d They say their names are [Sebastian & Barnaby](/doc/sebastian-barnaby-c5f2wjsPvu).\n\nThe party is creeped out by all this. Sopia asks her god their nature, and finds them to be undead. The mist rises up and begins to engulf houses around them, closing in, whiting out the surrounding world leaving the party standing her with only the house standing tall before them. When they turn around the kids are gone.\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=38244155-8a11-4ef8-bc7b-386ad009e02a \"left-50\")They go through the creaking wrought iron gate into the entry, where the wall is adorned with a [shield bearing the symbol of a windmill](/doc/shield-of-nightshade-8Z1MhlOIXG) against a purple field. Sopia takes it.\n\nThey continue through the house, discovering a coat closet with several red dresses and jackets. Atop a shelf lies the [hunting horn](/doc/hunting-horn-PkmJIssiGT) that they recognize Amelia blowing at [the hunt](/doc/session-24-the-hunt-tgDf5YJbgf).\n\nFurther in they find a dining room, set for a feast, with not a speck of dust on anything. They steal the silverware.\n\nThey find a kitchen and pantry with a dumbwaiter and a bell next to it. They send the dumbwaiter up, and when it returns there is a piping hot, beautifully roaster chicken atop a bed of perfectly roasted potatoes. A glass of fragrant red wine accompanies it. The party backs away from the kitchen without touching anything else.\n\nIn the front room, they find a study adorned with mounted buck\u2019s heads and several fur covered chairs surrounding a fire and a table made from a cask of wine. Three stuffed wolves stand in opposite corners of the room menacingly. Two cabinets attract their attention, Rado and Greyson check them out while the others check the fire place and find in it a human femur, badly charred.\n\nRado finds a wine cabinet, while Greyson picks the lock on the other and finds a [repeating crossbow](https://5e.dungeon.church/items.html#repeater%20crossbow%2c%20hand_ghpg) and a bunch of bolts in a weapons cabinet. \n\nSopia attempts to divine whether any evil lurks here, and feels only a foreboding sense of dread emanating from below the house.\n\n*They note that they\u2019ve checked everything on the first floor, but no sign of a passage down to a \u201cbasement\u201d\u2026.*\n\n## Second Floor\n\nThey head up the banner staircase, passing by oil painted portraits of figures who look vaguely familiar, flanked by two young boys. Here they find several doors, flanked by iron suits of black armor with helmets shaped into a wolf\u2019s head.\n\nThey try the door to the north, and find a library with a study desk adorned with writing items and wax seals (bearing the emblem of a windmill, again). They peruse the books but find only boring texts of history and genealogy. Until Greyson sees one suspicious looking book, worn in a manner that suggests it is pulled frequently\u2026\n\n\u2026he pulls it and a switch activates, one of the library cases along the wall audibly clicks, swinging open. A secret closet is revealed.\n\nInside they find the arcane books they were originally looking for - books on cults, summoning fiends, necromancy. They push aside the door more and see behind it an ornate wood chest on lead claw feet, and dangling out of it\u2019s opening is the dessicated husk and skeleton of an unfortunate adventurer or bandit some time past.\n\nThey pull his body aside and find in it several poison darts, evidently from the trapped chest.\n\nThey carefully pry it open and inside they find it lined with red velvet, and they smell the distinct scent of perfume\u2026 inside is only a single letter.\n\n> My dearest [Amelia](/doc/amelia-mAibH1T0Em),\\n\\nIt has been my greatest pleasure watching your transformation. You are the spark  that keeps my hearts beating. \\n\\nYou have enchanted me with your devotion, and together we shall weave a tapestry of fear and wonder in this land. I am not merely a guide to immortality; I am the embodiment of it. Your suffering, your sacrifices, they are but the first steps on the path to unparalleled power. \\n\\nSoon my love - we will reign together for eternity,\n>\n> \\n[Your Lady](/doc/lady-nightshade-3kjLNj2Zbs)\n\n ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=def4157f-1601-453b-a150-463e752cccd6)",
