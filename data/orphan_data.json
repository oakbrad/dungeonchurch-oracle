Kierst, then just a 15 year old, remembers the fall from grace bitterly as his prospects at education and life in society fell precipitously.  Fortunately he still had enough contacts to be invited to some social events and he turned to daring heists of jewelry, rare manuscripts, and purported magic items to help pay the debts his family held now that their business prospects fell.  He has recently left town for a period as some evidence has started to point to him as a perpetrator of the latest heist.",

Or is it deliberately crafting a new personality for yourself to perfectly both contrast *and* match the new micro-society you\u2019ll be joining?\n\nJethro believes it\u2019s the latter.\n\n\\\nJethro Honeyrock has travelled far and wide, not truly finding a place to settle down. From sneaking in and staying at a forgotten bedroom at an inn, to making makeshift shelters to scrape by in hidden alleyways. He's been sure to not get too tied down to one place or another, as when he'd run a gambling grift and be found out, he'd skip town. If he found himself with a bit of a gambling debt on his head, he'd also skip town.\n\nHe's a good bit shorter than the average dwarf, with a noticeably scrawnier stature, too. He hides it well, however, typically wearing a large, baggy cloak over his regular doubled-up garb to look bulkier than normal. When he'd skip town, he'd reinvent his appearance the best he can while still trying to look dwarf-like, from changing up his intricate beard braids, swapping out his entire wardrobe, to making more rash decisions such as intentionally giving himself a scar on his face when fleeing an especially bad situation.\n\nJethro's gambling related activities have slowed down after his most recent gambling run. For months, he played and cheated in an underground game run by The Queen's Men, but eventually his gambling grift went sideways. He found himself losing a lot of the money he had earned, specifically to a dwarf named Bhardok. When he somehow started to lose more than he won in a game rigged *in his* favor, Jethro started to get antsy and look for a way out.\n\n\\\n",

A creature frightened this way must spend its turns trying to move as far away from the rug as it can. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

The head snaps its jaws and the whole thing lunges forward, flat and threatening.*\n\n***Inn Protection.*** Inns and hunting lodges in remote locations often hire mages to make animated bearskin rugs. The rugs serve as seemingly harmless decorations that can instantly turn into guardians to drive away burglars, or into bouncers to break up bar fights.\n\n***Bearserk.*** There are rare cases of animated bearskin rugs suddenly going berserk and refusing to follow the commands of their masters. It is unknown what triggers such violence in the constructs. Berserk rugs need to be put down swiftly, as they attack any creature they notice.\n\n***Construct Nature.*** An animated bearskin rug doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.\n\n\n---\n\n- [x] [Source: Tome of Beasts 2, page 24](https://5e.dungeon.church/bestiary.html#animated%20bearskin%20rug_tob2)\n\n\\\n",

Hit: 6 (`1d8 + 2`) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 12).

Their hides are covered in thick chitin, and they have large, serrated mandibles flanking their mouths and stingers on their tails. These stingers are the size of a shortsword, and they're capable of stabbing and poisoning a human to death.\n\n***Colony Defenders.*** Giant ants form colonies under the control of a queen much like their normal-sized cousins. Sterile females form castes with the workers building the nest and caring for larvae. Queens and male drones rarely leave the colony. Soldiers defend the colony and forage for food.\n\n***Carry Prey Home.*** Giant ants are both predators and scavengers, working in organized groups to bring down large prey and carry it back to the nest. Giant ants tend to ignore animals away from the colony when not foraging for food, but they quickly move to overwhelm prey when hungry or threatened. A giant ant stands nearly four feet tall and weighs 400 pounds, while a giant ant queen is over five feet tall and weighs 900 pounds. Giant ants communicate with each other primarily with pheromones but also use sound and touch.",
